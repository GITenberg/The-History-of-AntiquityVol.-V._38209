<h3>THE LAND AND THE TRIBES.</h3>


<p>Between the valley of the Indus and the land of the
Euphrates and Tigris, bounded on the south by the
ocean and the Persian Gulf, on the north by the
broad steppes which the Oxus and Jaxartes vainly
attempt to fertilise, by the Caspian Sea and the valley
of the Aras, lies the table-land of Iran. Rising to an
average height of 4000 feet above the level of the sea,
it forms an oblong, the length of which from east to
west is something more than 1500 miles. The breadth
in the east is about 1000 miles, but at the narrowest
point, from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf, it is
not much more than 500 miles; while the western
edge, reaching from the Persian Gulf to the mountains
of Aderbeijan, again extends over a distance of about
750 miles.</p>

<p>In this seclusion, neither penetrated by bays of the
sea nor traversed by mighty rivers, the region exhibits
a certain similarity to the highlands of Arabia. The
centre of the Iranian land, like that of Arabia, is occupied
by a great desert where only nomadic life is possible.
But the soil of Iran is more diversified in regard to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>elevation and depression. The northern half of the
land is higher than the southern, the centre is hollowed
out in the form of a trough, so that in the east, at any
rate, the waters from the inner slopes of the mountainous
rim fall into the depression, and collect in
fructifying lakes. The oases and fertile valleys are
more numerous and extensive than in Arabia, and
though the rivers of the inner table-land, like the
streams of the northern edge, which flow to the north,
are lost in the sand or end in unimportant lakes, they
nevertheless render agriculture possible over wide
tracts of country.</p>

<p>The northern side is more diversified and superior
in formation to the south. The southern edge, which
sinks down to the ocean, closely resembles Arabia
in the climate and the nature of the country; the
mountains of the north, on the other hand, exhibit
green pastures and splendid forests where Arabia has
nothing but bare peaks: in the Hindu Kush, and
Elburz on the Caspian Sea, as well as in Aderbeijan,
they rise into vast Alpine districts. The eastern edge,
extending over a distance of 900 miles, rises like a
steep wall out of the valley of the Indus; a few long
and difficult passes lead from the Indus to the high
ground, which on the north commences with cold bare
flats, and on the south with slopes still more desolate
and barren, and at the same time intolerably hot. Only
the terraces of the valley of the Cabul, which flows
down into the Indus, allow a convenient exit towards
the north, and present a soil to a great extent so
fertile that three harvests can be reaped in the year.
The western edge of Iran, on the other hand, is formed
by parallel ridges running from the north-west to the
south-east, between which, beside extensive mountain
pastures, lie narrow and well-watered valleys. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
north-west the low-lying regions are rich in meadows
and forest; while those between the abutting ridges of
the western and southern edge are warm, and even hot,
in climate, rich and luxuriant in vegetation.</p>

<p>On this table-land the heat is softened, though not
entirely, by the elevation of the soil. After violent
storms in the spring, no cloud darkens the sky from
May to September; the atmosphere is peculiarly dry
and clear, and through the fine air can be seen, bright
and sharp, the outlines of the mountains and the whole
country, while at night the star-lit sky almost replaces
the light of day. The changes in temperature are
sudden and severe. From cold, snow-covered terraces,
8000 feet in height, we suddenly descend to the
glowing heat of the plains, lying barely 2000 feet
above the sea. In the north-east oppressive heat
alternates with great cold; the north suffers from a
severe winter, with heavy falls of snow and icy storms,
blowing over the Caspian Sea and the broad steppes; in
the south the air is filled with the dust of the desert,
here extraordinarily fine, and the hot winds give the
heaps of sand the appearance of changing waves, and
roll masses of it to the sky.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>As far back as our information extends, we find the
table-land of Iran occupied by a group of nations
closely related to each other, and speaking dialects
of the same language. On the edges of that great
desert, which occupies the centre of the land, are
tracts of pasture, and further inland, treeless steppes,
which, however, are watered here and there by
brackish pools, and produce a salt vegetation barely
sufficient to provide buffaloes and camels with sustenance,
until the soil becomes entirely barren. In the
western part of these steppes wandered a pastoral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
people, whom Herodotus calls Sagartians. They were
horsemen, but, according to the historian's statement,
carried no weapons of attack beyond a dagger and a
rope of twisted straps, at one end of which was a loop.
In this they placed their confidence in battle; they
threw it over men and horses, and so dragged them
down and strangled them. In the inscriptions of the
Ach&aelig;menids this nation is called <i>A&ccedil;agarta</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Close to the Indus, and beyond the bare, hot, treeless
shores of the ocean, the southern part of the plain
consists of sandy flats, in which nothing grows but
prickly herbs and a few palms. The springs are a
day's journey from each other, and often more. This
region was possessed by a people whom Herodotus
calls Sattagyd&aelig;, and the companions of Alexander of
Macedonia, Gedrosians.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Among the nations of the
East who were subject to them, the inscriptions of the
Ach&aelig;menids mention the "<i>Thataghus</i>," which the
Greeks understood as Sattagush and Gadrush. Neighbours
of the Gandarians, who, as we know, dwelt on
the right bank of the Indus down to the Cabul, the
Gedrosians led a wandering, predatory life; under the
Persian kings they were united into one satrapy with
the Gandarians.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> To the south of the Gedrosians, on
the coast, there dwelt, according to the Greeks, a
miserable race, eaters of fish and tortoises, who built<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
their houses of the bones of whales thrown up by the
sea. They wove their nets from the bark of palms,
and their weapons were javelins hardened in the fire.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The edge on the south allows no streams of any size
to flow to the sea, so that even to this day this coast
presents only a few small fertile spots. About equally
distant from the northern and southern edge of the
table-land, to the east of the desert of the interior, lies
a considerable lake, now called Hamun, but known
to the Greeks as Areios. It forms the centre of a cultivated
district, though the storms from the west often
drive the sand of the desert to its shores. This basin
is formed by and receives important streams flowing
from the inner slopes of the northern and eastern edge.
From the southern spurs of the Hindu Kush comes
the Hilmend, the Haetumat of the Avesta, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> rich
in bridges, the Etymandros of the Greeks, which has a
course of about 400 miles, and before falling into the
lake is joined by the Arghandab. The Lora, which
flows from the east, but further to the south, does not
now reach the lake. From the north flow the Harut
and Chashrud. Round this lake, and on the banks of the
Hilmend, the Arghandab, and the Lora, lies a fruitful
region; higher up the walls of the valleys are covered
with forests, until towards the east the upper course of
the rivers is enclosed by bare cliffs. On the shores of
the Hamun, and in the valley of the Hilmend, dwelt a
people whom the inscriptions of the Ach&aelig;menids call
<i>Zaraka</i>, i.&nbsp;e. dwellers on the lake. A lake in Old
Persian is <i>Daraya</i>; in the ancient language of the East,
<i>Zarayanh</i>; in modern Persian, <i>Zareh</i>. Hence we
understand why Herodotus calls this nation Sarangians,
the later Greeks, Zarangians and Drangians.
According to the Greeks the Zarakas were a warlike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
nation, armed with Median bows and spears, unsurpassed
in battle on horseback; and a tribe of them
which lived under good and equitable laws bore the
name of Aria&ccedil;pians.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The ruins of cities and works of
irrigation testify to the former prosperity of this region.
East of the Zarakas, up the valley of the Arghandab,
dwelt the Arachoti. In the inscriptions of the Ach&aelig;menids
they are called <i>Harauvati</i>; in the Avesta,
<i>Harahvaiti</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the rich in water. These names the
Arachoti received from the river on which they were
settled, the older name of which was Arachotus
(<i>Sarasvati</i>).<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Herodotus does not designate the
Arachoti by this name derived from the river of their
land, but by the tribal name of Pactyes; he tells us
that they wore peculiar bows, daggers, and skins.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The Afghans, who in ancient times occupied the region
from the Suleiman mountains on the east as far as
the Arghandab on the west, Shorawak on the south,
the Cabul and the range of the Sefid-Kuh on the
north, and in the middle ages forced their way to
Cabul and Peshawur, still call themselves Pashtun and
Pakhtun, or Rohilo, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> mountaineers. They still speak
their old rough mountain language, which is closely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
connected with the dialects of the Arian tribes on the
Indus.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Eastward of Elburz, the point where the northern
edge of Iran again rises into a lofty range to the west
(Demavend is more than 18,000 feet in height), and
then sinks down to the Caspian Sea, lay the Hyrcanians.
In the inscriptions of the Ach&aelig;menids their
land is known as <i>Varkana</i>; the modern name is Jorjan.
Here, according to the Greeks, the mountains were
covered with forests of oaks, where swarms of wild
bees had their hives; in the valleys vines and fig-trees
flourished, and the soil down to the sea was so luxuriant
that corn grew from the fallen grains without
any special sowing.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The description is hardly exaggerated.
The waters pouring from the heights and
snow-fields of Elburz water the soil of the coast so
thoroughly, that a tropical growth flourishes in Jorjan,
Taberistan, and Ghilan, the luxuriance of which is
assisted by the volcanic heat of the earth. The
lagunes of the coast are succeeded by marsh forests;
higher up are fields of rice and plantations of sugarcane,
and beyond these fertile meadows, above which
splendid forests of oaks, planes, and elms clothe the
heights of Elburz. There is abundance of water fruits,
figs and mulberries, olives and oranges, and the
vigorous creepers of the vines run even to the summits
of the trees.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Nevertheless, these favoured regions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
have a darker side. Frequent earthquakes disturb the
soil; in the winter furious north winds blowing over
the Caspian rage along the walls of Elburz, and even
on the outlying spurs the snow falls to the depth of
several fathoms; the rain-clouds, hemmed in by the
mountain ranges, often burst in water-spouts, which
lay the land far and wide under water, and roll as
torrents down the gorges; the marsh air blanches the
inhabitants, while in the summer the hot and moist
climate breeds deadly fever.</p>

<p>Further to the east, where the Caspian Sea ends and
the mountains of Iran descend towards the desolate,
pathless steppes of the Oxus, is a wild, hilly country.
In the depressions, and there only, the region of the
Parthians (<i>Parthava</i> in the inscriptions of the Ach&aelig;menids<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>)
exhibits fruitful lands, and, further eastward
still, agriculture is favoured by the long, narrow valley
of the Areios (Herirud). Springing from the southern
slope of the Hindu Kush, the river flows towards
the west along the inner edge of the table-land, till
it bursts through the northern barrier in order to lose
itself in the sand of the steppes. In this valley the
district of the modern Herat, lay the Areians, who
are called <i>Haraiva</i> in the inscriptions of the Persian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>kings. The name points to the possession of water. To
the north of the Areians, in the valley of the Margos
(now Murghab), which rises in the northern edge of
the table-land, and flows to the north-west, where it
also ends in the sands of the desert, in Margiana (Old
Persian, Marghush; Bactrian, Mouru; modern Merv),
lay the Margiani, in a well-cultivated region, rich in
vineyards, with numerous cities and a large population.
But the fertility only extends so far as the soil
can be watered from the Margos and the neighbouring
streams.</p>

<p>At the foot of the mountain barrier, towards the
northern steppes, and on the edge of the steppes of
the Oxus, to the north of the Hyrcanians, Parthians,
and Margiani, in a land which only partially admits
of agriculture, lay the Chorasmians, a people partly
stationary and partly migratory&mdash;the <i>Uvarazmiya</i>
of the Ach&aelig;menids, the <i>Hvairizem</i> of the Avesta.
Further to the east, where the edge rises to the lofty
Hindu Kush, there lies on its northern slope a favoured
district in the region of the Upper Oxus. That river
flows from the table-land of Pamire, which lies more
than 15,000 feet above the sea, exactly at the point
where the Hindu Kush abuts on the Belurdagh, the
western edge of the central table-land. On the banks
of the river, which flows in a north-westerly direction,
extend broad mountain pastures, where support is found
in the fresh mountain air for numerous herds of horses
and sheep, and beneath the wooded hills are blooming
valleys. On these slopes of the Hindu Kush, the
middle stage between the table-land and the deep
plain of the Caspian Sea, lay the Bactrians&mdash;the <i>Bakhtri</i>
of the Ach&aelig;menids, the <i>Bakhdhi</i> of the Avesta.
Curtius, following the accounts of the companions of
Alexander, tells us of the land of the Bactrians that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
was much diversified in character; in one part were pastures,
another was rich in beautiful fruit-trees and vines,
and frequent springs watered the rich soil, on which
corn was cultivated. These districts supported a large
number of oxen and horses. Under the range of
Paropanisos (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> on the slope of the Hindu Kush) lay
the city of Bactra, on the river of the same name,
which washed its walls. But a great part of the country
was covered with waste tracts of sand. If the winds
blew from the Caspian Sea, they swept the sand into
high hills, under which not only did every trace of
the road disappear, but travellers were at times overwhelmed;
and, as if voyaging by sea, it was necessary
to guide the course by the stars.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Strabo remarks,
after Apollodorus of Artemita, that Bactria was the
best part of East Iran (Ariana). In ancient times the
Bactrians were hardly distinguished from nomads;
but their land was extensive, and produced fruits of all
kinds, with the exception of the vine. The fertility
of the land enabled the Hellenic princes to make great
conquests. Their cities were Bactra, traversed by the
river of the same name, Darapsa, Aornus (<i>avarana</i>,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> protection), Kariata, and many others, and besides
these cities, the Bactrians had citadels on lofty rocks.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
According to Strabo, Bactra was also called Zariaspa,
and Pliny asserts that at any rate in earlier times it
was called by that name. In Arrian Zariaspa is the
largest city of Bactria, while Ptolemy places Zariaspa
to the north of Bactra, on the bank of the Oxus.
Zariaspa means golden horse. A river might possibly
be known by such a name, but hardly a city, unless it
belonged to a tribe of the name of Zariaspians, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
was inhabited by them. In fact Ptolemy places the
tribe of the Zariaspians in his Zariaspa.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The air on these north-western terraces of the Hindu
Kush is warm, and the soil sufficiently vigorous, under
irrigation, to produce rice and southern fruits. Eight
leagues below the snow-fields of the mountains, which
resist even the hottest months of the year, two good
leagues to the north of the place where the Dehas,
after forcing a passage through the last heights, reaches
the plains, lies the city of Balkh, on the banks of that
river. At this day it is a town only partially inhabited;
but the ruins of the ancient city are said to
cover a circuit of several leagues. The adjacent soil
is now well cultivated; the fields are thickly planted
with trees, and beside old water-courses, now dried up,
and extensive ruins of yet older aqueducts, eighteen
channels still convey their rills to fields under active
cultivation.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>North of the Bactrians, beyond the Oxus, on the
western slope of Belurdagh, in the valley of the Polytimetus
(Zarefshan, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> strewing gold), which flows
towards the Oxus from the east, but, instead of joining
it, ends in Lake Dengiz, lay the Sogdiani of the Greeks,
the <i>Suguda</i> of the Old Persian inscriptions, and <i>&Ccedil;ughdha</i>
of the Avesta, in the region of the modern Sogd.
As the Oxus in its upper course separates the Bactrians
from the Sogdiani, the Jaxartes, further to the north,
separates the latter from the Scyths. According to
Strabo, the manners of the Bactrians and Sogdiani
were similar, but the Bactrians were less rude.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Maracanda
(Samarcand), the chief city of the Sogdiani, on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the Polytimetus, is said to have had a circuit of 70
stades in the fourth century <small>B.C.</small> The soil is not
without fertility, but the climate varies between great
heat and severe cold.</p>

<p>Herodotus observes that the Bactrians, who carried
bows of reed and short lances, closely resembled the
northern Indians in armour, clothing, and mode of
life, and then informs us that the Areians, Parthians,
Sogdiani, and Chorasmians resembled the Bactrians.
All these tribes of the east, according to the account
of Herodotus, carried the Indian bow of reed; the
Areians alone used the Median bow, which Herodotus
states to have been in vogue not only among the Medes,
but also among all the nations of Western Iran. He
adds that in ancient times the Medes were called
Areians by all men. Strabo uses the name Ariana for
the land of all the nations of Iran, except that of the
Medes and Persians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> for the whole eastern half
of Iran.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In Diodorus also the nations of Eastern Iran
are Arians.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The Avesta, which, as we shall show,
belongs to the east of Iran, calls its native land <i>Airyao
Dahvyu</i>, i.&nbsp;e. abode of the Airyas; or <i>Airyao Danhavo</i>,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> land of the Airyas, in contrast to the <i>Anairyao
Danhavo</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the non-Arian lands.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In his inscriptions
king Darius styles himself "a Persian, son of a
Persian, an Arian (<i>ariya</i>) of an Arian tribe,"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and therefore
the name must have held good of the west of Iran
also, and have included all the nations of Iran, though
afterwards it continued in use more especially for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
tribes of the east. The inhabitants of the modern
Persian kingdom call their kingdom by the general
name of Iran. Iran is only the regular new Persian
form of the old name, which in the west was pronounced
Ariyana, and in the east Airyana.</p>

<p>We remember that the ruling nation of India called
themselves Arya, and this name compared with Airya
and Ariya shows us that the nations of Iran assumed
the same title with very little difference. Among the
Greeks Ariya and Airya became Areioi and Arioi, and
the name of the land, Ariyana and Airyana, became
Ariana. We have learnt the meaning of the names
Aryas, Ariyas, Airyas; they signify "the noble or
ruling people" (IV. 8). Much the same is the sense
of the name Art&aelig;ans,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> which, according to the assertion
of Herodotus, was the title by which the Persians
called themselves; it signifies "the exalted," or
"mighty." The Persians may have assumed it after
they became the ruling people in Iran and Hither
Asia.</p>

<p>These distinctions show us that the Aryas whom we
found on the Indus and in the Panjab, and who forced
their way from thence to the conquest and colonisation
of the valley of the Ganges, and then extended
their dominion over the Deccan, and imported their
religion and their civilisation into those wide regions,
were closely connected with the group of nations which
occupied the table-land of Iran. It is obvious that
this relationship was most strictly maintained and
most strongly marked where the intercourse between
the neighbouring nations was most lively, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> among
the nations of Eastern Iran. The conclusion drawn
from the common title of the two nations on the west
and east of the Indus, and from the statements of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Herodotus about the manners of the eastern and the
name of the western nations of Iran, is confirmed by
the examination of the existing remnants of the
ancient languages of Iran, whether spoken in the east
or the west. This evidence derived from the names
and the language is confirmed yet further by the
coincidence in certain traits of religion and worship.</p>

<p>We are not in a position to fix the place from which
and the time when the Arian tribes entered the table-land
of Iran and peopled it. That Iran was not
their native country is clear from the divergence of
the Arian stock from the common stem of the Indo-Europeans
(IV. 4). Still less can we decide whether
the Arians found an older population already settled
in Iran. So far as the ancient monuments of east
and west allow us to form an opinion, there exist no
elements of an alien language from which we could
deduce the existence of an earlier population, which
the Arians conquered. Yet we cannot deny that
tribes of an alien origin and character were settled on
the western spurs of the mountain wall of Iran, in the
north no less than in the south.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The foreign elements
which the later forms of the language of Iran have
adopted are due to the influence which the Semitic
neighbours of the Arians on the west, and the
dominion of the Arabs, exercised on Iran. As to the
direction in which the Arians entered Iran, we can
only conclude, from their close relationship to the Arians
of India, that they peopled the east of Iran before the
west. If the Arians of India came into the Panjab, as
we assumed, soon after 2000 <small>B.C.</small>, the Arians of Iran
entered the eastern part of that country at a date
certainly not later. According to the list of dynasties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
furnished by Berosus, the Arians about 2500 <small>B.C.</small> were
not only settled in Iran, but already possessed the
western part of the country. He represents the Medes
as conquering Babylonia in 2458 <small>B.C.</small>, and from this
date down to 2224 <small>B.C.</small> mentions eight Median kings
as ruling over Babylon (I. 241, 247).</p>

<p>In spite of their cruel treatment, the nucleus of the
ancient Arian population of Iran has not succumbed to
the alien dynasties, the Seleucids, Arabs, and Mongols
who have invaded the land since the fall of the Ach&aelig;menids;
and the ancient territory has been maintained,
with some losses, even against the incursions
and immigrations of the Sac&aelig;, Yu&euml;chis, and Turkish
hordes. As in the vast regions of the Indus and the
Ganges, so in Iran the ancient language still lives
on the lips of the modern population. Yet the
changes have been great. Under the Arsacids the Old
Persian passed into Middle Persian, which at a later
time was known by the name of the Parthians, the
tribe at that time supreme in Persia. Pahlav and
Pehlevi mean Parthian, and, as applied to language,
the language of the Parthians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the Parthian era.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
In the west this older Middle Persian grew up out of
the Old Persian, in the east out of the Old Bactrian.
In the latest period of the dominion of the Sassanids,
the recent Middle Persian or Parsee took the place of
Pehlevi. When the kingdom of the Sassanids succumbed
to the Arabs, and Arabic became the language
of the ruling people in Iran, the reaction which took
place in the eastern districts of the country against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
dominion of the Abbasids brought about the formation
of the new Persian, which was finally completed
when the national reaction broke out in the beginning
of the eleventh century of our era. Beginning from
Merv, Balkh, and Sejestan (the ancient Haetumat), that
rising found its strongest point in Ghasna and Cabul.
It did not preserve the religion, but it saved the
language, nationality, and independence of Iran. The
change from the Middle Persian to the modern began
with the north-eastern dialects; in the south-east the
Afghans and Beluchees still speak in ancient forms,
closely akin to the dialects of the peasants of the Panjab.
To this day the greater part of the entire population
of Iran consists of the descendants of the Arians, in
spite of all the distress and ruin which the land has
suffered,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> though the residuum of foreign elements is
larger here than beyond the Indus, especially in the
north-west, in Aderbeijan, and above all in Bactria and
Sogdiana, in the north-east. The descendants of the
Arians are still recognised by the formation of their
bodies, which appeared so striking to Western nations
in antiquity&mdash;the slender growth, the semicircular,
united eyebrows, and the yellow skin, which becomes
browner towards the east. The Persians and Afghans
still possess a sound judgment, a keen intelligence, and
lively sense of poetry&mdash;characteristics which, as we
saw, belonged in a pre-eminent degree to the Arians
of India.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE KINGDOM OF THE BACTRIANS.</h3>


<p>Among the ruins of the residence of the kings of
Asshur at Chalah, on the confluence of the Greater Zab
and the Tigris, was discovered the obelisk which
Shalmanesar II., who reigned from 859 to 823 <small>B.C.</small> over
Assyria, erected in memory of his successes. In the
tribute offered to him we find the rhinoceros, the
elephant, the humped ox, and the camel with two
humps (II. 320). This species of camel and the yak are
found in Bactria, on the southern edge of the Caspian
Sea, and in Tartary, and we afterwards find elephants
in the possession of the rulers of Bactria.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Hence, in
order to obtain these animals for tribute, the armies of
Shalmanesar must have advanced as far as the eastern
tribes of the Iranian table-land. From the inscriptions
of Tiglath Pilesar II., it is clear that he advanced
along the same table-land as far as the Hilmend
and the Arachoti, if not as far as Bactria. Among
the lands subjugated in 745 <small>B.C.</small>, he enumerates Nisaa,
Zikruti, and Arakuttu. In Nisaa we cannot mistake
Nis&aelig;a in the east of Media (p. 31). The Zikruti were
no doubt the Sagartians of Herodotus, the A&ccedil;agarta
of the old Persian inscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Arakuttu represents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in a Semitic form the name of the Arachoti, the
Harauvati of the Ach&aelig;menids (p. 8). So far as we
can at present judge from inscriptions, the successors of
Tiglath Pilesar did not carry their campaigns further
to the east of Iran, and we can assert with certainty
of both the sovereigns who raised the power of Assyria
to its summit, Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal (681-626
<small>B.C.</small>), that they made no conquests in this direction.</p>

<p>If the inscriptions of the Assyrians leave us in
almost total darkness about Bactria, the Medo-Persian
epic poetry can give us full information about the
country. When Ninus, king of Assyria, had subjugated
all the nations of Asia as far as the Nile and the
Tanais, he made an attempt upon Bactria, but without
success. The entrance into the land was difficult, the
number of warriors great, and they knew how to fight
bravely. Then Ninus collected an army of two millions
of soldiers, which was opposed by Oxyartes, the
king of the Bactrians, with 400,000 men. When the
Assyrian army came in detachments out of the passes,
Oxyartes attacked and drove them back into the
mountains with the loss of 100,000 men. The army
of Ninus then combined, outnumbered and overcame
the Bactrians, and scattered them into their cities,
which Ninus took with little trouble. But Bactra,
where was the palace of the kings, was large and well
supplied, and had a very strong citadel in a high
position, while the city extended over the plain. It
resisted for a long time, till Semiramis ascended the
citadel, and Ninus was enabled to take possession of
the treasures of gold and silver which were in Bactra.
At a later time Semiramis collected her vast army
for the invasion of India in Bactria, and returned
to Bactra after she had been defeated on the Indus,
and had lost two-thirds of her army (II. 10). Such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
are the descriptions given by the epic poetry of the
Medes and Persians, in the account of the rise of
Assyria and subjugation of Bactria. The Bactrians are
again brought forward in the narrative of the overthrow
of Assyria, which was the proper theme of these poems.
When Sardanapalus has already thrice defeated the
Medes and Babylonians, a strong force comes to his
assistance from Bactria. The leader of the Medes
determines to attack this first, if it would not join in
the contest for freedom against Assyria. The Bactrians
joined the Medes, the power of Assyria was broken,
and Nineveh destroyed (III. 253).</p>

<p>From these poems it follows that in the first half of
the sixth century <small>B.C.</small>, in which the Medo-Persian epic
attained its original form, the tradition, or at any rate
the opinion, existed among the minstrels of Media that
a powerful kingdom and large metropolis once existed
in Bactria, the situation of which is correctly described.
This kingdom possessed a strong citadel and abundant
treasures, and could put in the field a large army of
brave warriors. Without such a conception they could
not represent the first attack of the Assyrians on
Bactria as a failure, the second as successful only
after considerable time and trouble had been spent,
and the conquest as the last and greatest achievement
of Ninus, the mightiest sovereign of Assyria, which he
only performed with the aid of Semiramis.</p>

<p>The inscriptions of the Assyrians have already informed
us that no dominion of Assyria over Eastern
Iran existed in the earliest period of the kingdom; on
the contrary, even when her power was at the highest
Assyria could only carry on temporary excursions
into that region. The western part of the country
was first trodden by the armies of Shalmanesar II.;
his inscriptions mention tribute of the Medes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
from the inscriptions of his successors it is distinctly
clear that only the nations of Western Iran were
tributary dependants of the kings of Asshur from
the period of Tiglath Pilesar, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> from the middle of
the eighth century <small>B.C.</small>, till the period of Phraortes and
Cyaxares of Media, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> till the middle of the seventh
century <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The conquests of Cyrus, who overthrew the power
of the Medes, founded the Persian empire, and extended
it to the east, would give us more accurate information
about Eastern Iran if connected accounts of these were
in existence. Herodotus contents himself with stating
that Cyrus, after subjugating the Lydians, determined to
march against the Bactrians and Sac&aelig;. He conquered
all the nations of Upper Asia, one after the other,
without omitting any.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Ctesias relates that the Bactrians
after a doubtful battle submitted voluntarily
to Cyrus. According to the account of Xenophon, the
Hyrcanians, Cadusians, and Sac&aelig; joined Cyrus, and in
the fragments of Nicolaus also the Hyrcanians, Parthians,
and "the other nations" passed over to Cyrus
immediately after the conquest of the Medes. However
this may be, there is no doubt that the east of
Iran was subject to Cyrus. He marched through the
land of the Arachoti, entered into relations with the
Aria&ccedil;pas (p. 8), and subjugated the Gandarians on
the south of the Cabul. He is also said to have
imposed tribute on the A&ccedil;vakas to the north of the
river (IV. 384). The Sogdiani, in any case, were his
vassals. On a stream which flows into the Jaxartes
he built a fortress called by his own name, known to
the Greeks as Cyresbata (<i>ultima Cyra</i>, or with others
Cyropolis), <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the furthest Cyrus. The walls and
citadels were strong and spacious, and in the neigh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>bourhood
were six other citadels.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The value placed
by Cyrus on the regions of Eastern Iran is not only
clear from these fortresses, but may be deduced from
the statement that his second son Bardya, whom the
Greeks call Smerdis, was intrusted with the government
of Bactria, if indeed the statement is genuine.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The nations and condition of Eastern Iran can be
ascertained more clearly from the inscriptions of
Darius. According to his inscription at Behistun,
his empire in that direction comprised the Parthians,
Sarangians, Areians, Chorasmians, Bactrians, Sogdiani,
Gandarii, Sattagyd&aelig;, Arachoti, and Sac&aelig;; and to these
the Idhus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Indians on the right bank of the
upper course of the Indus, are added in the inscriptions
of Persepolis and Naksh-i-Rustem.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Further
information is preserved by Herodotus with respect
to the tribute imposed by Darius on these nations.
As these statements are undoubtedly derived from
Persian tribute lists, they serve to throw a side light
on the state of civilisation existing in the east of Iran
at the division of the sixth and fifth centuries <small>B.C.</small>
The Sarangians, who, as we have seen (p. 7), inhabited
the fertile land round Lake Areios (Hamun),
together with the Sagartians and some neighbouring
nations on the south, paid yearly 600 Babylonian
talents into the treasury of the king. The Areians
(Haraivas), Parthians, Sogdiani, and Chorasmians, who
formed the sixteenth satrapy of the Persian empire,
had to pay 300 talents; the Gedrosians and Gandarians
together paid 170 talents; the Caspiani (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
no doubt, the Tapurians and other tribes on the
southern shore of the Caspian Sea) and the Sac&aelig;, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
traversed the steppes of the Oxus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the fifteenth
satrapy, paid 250 talents; and the Bactrians, the
twelfth satrapy of the empire, paid 360 talents.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
These sums, which do not include the whole of the
burdens of the provinces, but are only the land taxes
which they had to pay,&mdash;in addition, tolls were levied
and contributions in kind to the court of the king and
the satraps, as well as for the maintenance of the army,&mdash;show
that at the time of Darius agriculture and
wealth had proceeded far beyond the earliest stages
in the eastern districts of Iran. The Babylonian silver
talent amounts to more than 2000 thalers (6000
shillings).<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> If a sum of more than 1,200,000 thalers
(&pound;180,000) could be raised every year in land tax
from the districts round Lake Hamun, extensive
though they were, and 720,000 thalers (&pound;108,000) in
a similar manner from the land of the Bactrians, the
gardens, fields, and pastures of these regions must have
been considerable in breadth, and of great fertility.</p>

<p>Beyond this indication of the state of the civilisation
in these districts, we learn but little of their fortunes
under the dominion of the Persians. Darius (521-485
<small>B.C.</small>) informs us, at the beginning of his reign, that his
father Hystaspes (Vista&ccedil;pa), his viceroy in Persia, the
native land of the kingdom, and with him Vivana the
Persian, the satrap of Arachosia, and Dadarshis the
Persian, the satrap of Bactria, had quelled the rebellions
of the Parthians, Hyrcanians, and Margiani;
that the Mede Takhma&ccedil;pada had conquered the rebellious
Sagartians, and captured their leader, Chitratakhma,
whom he, Darius, had crucified at Arbela.
The army of the second Pseudo-Smerdis, which attempted
to gain possession of Arachosia, Vivana had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
defeated at the fortress of Kapisakani, in Arachosia,
and the leaders, with their chief associates, had been
captured in the fortress of Arsada and put to death.
Hystaspes had slain 6560 men of the Parthians and
Hyrcanians, and taken 4182 of them captives. Dadarshis
had subjugated the Mardians by slaying 4203
of them in battle, and taking 6562 of them captive.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Xerxes, the successor of Darius, successively intrusted
two of his brothers, Masistes and then Hystaspes,
with the government of Bactria.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In the great campaign
against Hellas, the Bactrians, like all the other
nations of the kingdom, had to furnish their contingent;
and when Mardonius had to select the best troops
in the army in Hellas, in order to winter with them in
Thessaly, he retained, besides the Persians and Medes,
the infantry and cavalry of the Bactrians, Sac&aelig;,
and Indians.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The Bactrians, under their viceroy
Hystaspes, revolted against Artaxerxes, the brother
of Hystaspes. The first battle was not decisive; in
the second Artaxerxes conquered, "because the wind
blew in the face of the Bactrians," and subjugated
the land.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> To the army of Darius III. with which
he met the Macedonians in Assyria, the Bactrians
contributed 30,000 cavalry; and in the battle of
Arbela they fought with the Arachoti on the left wing.
Accompanied by Bactrian horsemen, Darius escaped
from the field of battle to Media, and sought afterwards
to maintain his position in their country. The
Caspian gates, the pass of Damaghan, were gained,
when the satrap of Bactria got possession of the king,
and put him to death before he reached Bactria. The
satrap hoped to establish an independent power
there,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> but without success. Though Alexander at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
first overcame the Bactrians, who were astonished at
his rapid approach, he soon found a stubborn resistance
in Sogdiana and Bactria, which occupied him for two
years.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Not till then could he make his preparations
in Bactria for the invasion of India, and collect at
Bactra the army intended for the subjugation of that
country, in order to pass over the Hindu Kush into
the valley of the Cabul.</p>

<p>In the contests which the successors of Alexander
carried on for the supremacy after his death, the
valley of the Euphrates and Tigris, and the table-land
of Iran, finally fell to the lot of Seleucus. But in
the middle of the third century (256 <small>B.C.</small>), Arsaces in
Parthia and the satrap Diodotus in Bactria rebelled
against the second successor, Antiochus Theos. The
descendants of Arsaces not only succeeded in maintaining
their independence against the Seleucids, in
spite of severe reverses, but Mithridates I., the sixth
Arsacid (174-136 <small>B.C.</small>), united all Iran under his
dominion. The Greeks lost their supremacy, and Iran
again became subject to native princes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Diodotus had founded an independent
supremacy in Bactria. His son, of the same name, was
succeeded by Euthydemus, against whom, towards the
year 200 <small>B.C.</small>, Antiochus III. marched, in order to force
Bactria to submission. Euthydemus was defeated at
the river Areios (p. 10), and fled to Zariaspa. By
the surrender of his elephants he obtained an established
recognition from Antiochus. Demetrius and
Eucratides, the successors of Euthydemus (after 180
<small>B.C.</small>), extended the sphere of their dominion to the
east over the land on the Cabul to the Indus. The
kingdom of Chandragupta, Vindusara, and A&ccedil;oka, which,
as we know, included the east of Iran, and has left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
us inscriptions at Peshawur (IV. 525), fell to pieces
under A&ccedil;oka's grandsons.  Apollodorus of Artemita
told us above that the fertility of the Bactrian soil
enabled the Greek rulers to make important conquests
(p. 12); he informs us that Eucratides founded the
city of Eucratideia in Bactria, and subjugated a
thousand cities in India. We may assume that Bactria
under these princes was not merely powerful,
but prosperous. According to the statement of Justin,
a thousand cities were at that time enumerated in
Bactria,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and we possess satisfactory evidence that
these rulers and their courts, and the Greek settlements
which Alexander founded in the distant East,
were able permanently to establish the style and art of
Hellas. The coins of these princes, who are designated
in Greek as "kings," "great," "invincible," rival the
best work which proceeded from Greek mints. The
faces present the heads of the princes, in characteristic
and individual portraits; the reverses exhibit Heracles,
Athena, Apollo with a crown of rays, the Dioscuri on
horseback, lance in hand. But by degrees the national
types of the East are again employed on these coins.
The reverse presents the galloping horse, the animal of
Bactria, the elephant, and the humped ox.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The head
of Demetrius, who first conquered territory in India,
and that of some of his descendants, is covered by a
helmet adorned with the tusks and trunk of an
elephant. Besides the round, numbers of rectangular
coins have also been found, from which we can discover
the native traditional form of the Bactrian coinage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
After the reign of Eucratides these rectangular coins
present on one side Greek inscriptions, which are
repeated in other characters on the reverse. To the
inscriptions of king A&ccedil;oka at Kapur-i-Giri, and to
these coins, together with those of the Gr&aelig;co-Indian
kings, and some later coins belonging to the Arsacids
and the Indo-Scythian princes, we owe the information
that the east of Iran possessed a peculiar alphabet and
mode of writing, while the Medes and Persians of the
west borrowed their earliest letters from the Assyrio-Babylonian
cuneiform writing, and afterwards, from
about the fourth century <small>B.C.</small>, adopted the cursive
character of the Aram&aelig;ans.</p>

<p>Although, as we may conclude from these indications,
the Greek sovereigns of Bactria resolved to pay a
certain respect to the civilisation of their subjects,
their kingdom was short-lived. The nations of the
steppes of the Oxus, themselves under pressure, began
to advance to the south (after 160 <small>B.C.</small>); in the west
the Parthians rose into power. Mithridates I. of Parthia
incorporated Bactria in his kingdom about 140
<small>B.C.</small>, and Bactria subsequently became a part of the
Parthian empire. Heliocles, the son of Eucratides, was
thus limited to the land of the Cabul and Indus, but
on the borders of India the power and influence of the
Greeks remained unbroken. Greek captains&mdash;Menander,
and after him Apollodotus, who had previously
no doubt been subject to the Bactrians&mdash;issued
from the southern slope of the Hindu Kush in the
last decades of the second century <small>B.C.</small>, and conquered
the land of the Indus as far as the mouth of the river,
and the Panjab. They advanced to the Yamuna, and
reduced Surashtra (Guzerat) and Cashmere to dependence.
Even at the end of the first century <small>B.C.</small>
coins of these princes were current on the coast of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Surashtra, and they are still found on the banks of
the Yamuna.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>On the western coast of India, from the Gulf of
Cambay to Bombay, we find from one hundred to one
hundred and fifty thousand families whose ancestors
migrated thither from Iran. The tradition among them
is, that at the time when the Arabs, after conquering
Iran and becoming sovereigns there, persecuted and
eradicated the old religion, faithful adherents of the
creed fled to the mountains of Kerman. Driven from
these by the Arabs (in Kerman and Yezd a few
hundred families are still found who maintain the
ancient faith<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>), they retired to the island of Hormuz
(a small island close by the southern coast, at the
entrance to the Persian Gulf). From hence they
migrated to Din (on the coast of Guzerat), and then
passed over to the opposite shore. In the neighbourhood
of Bombay and in the south of India inscriptions
have been found which prove that these settlers reached
the coast in the tenth century of our era.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> At the
present time their descendants form a considerable
part of the population of Surat, Bombay, and Ahmadabad;
they call themselves, after their ancient home,
Parsees, and speak the later Middle Persian (the
Parsee, p. 17). Their worship and life they regulate
by the rules given in certain scriptures which they
brought with them from their ancient home. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
are fragments of a much larger whole, part of a book
of law, and a collection of sacrificial songs and
prayers. The Parsees no longer speak or understand
the language of these scriptures (the Avesta), and
even the priests, who use them every day, ascertain
the meaning through an accompanying translation into
the later language.</p>

<p>That these scriptures arose in the east of Iran is
clear from the language of the Avesta. It exhibits a
close relationship with the forms of the Veda and
Sanskrit, the ancient language of the Arians in India.
If, on the other hand, we compare the language of the
Avesta with the ancient language of Western Iran as
we possess it in the inscriptions of the Ach&aelig;menids,
we find that both are merely different dialects of one
language, but they differ in such a manner that the
language of the inscriptions of Darius and Xerxes is
less closely connected with Sanskrit than the language
of the Avesta. This language then we may regard as
the ancient speech of Eastern Iran, and this assumption
is raised into evidence by the contents of the
Avesta. These prove that the Avesta arose in the
east of Iran, with even greater certainty than the
songs of the Rigveda prove that that collection arose
in the land of the Indus and the Panjab. The Avesta
entirely ignores the west of Iran. No mention is
made of Ecbatana and Pasargad&aelig;, the abode of the
Median and the Persian kings, though they reigned over
the whole of Iran and Hither Asia; nor even of the
nations of the west, the Medes and Persians. It
speaks of the land of the seven streams, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> India
(IV. 12), and the heat which prevails in that land;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
it mentions the beautiful Harahvaiti (Arachosia) and
Haetumat (afterwards Sejestan<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>): the latter is extolled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
as a beaming, glowing, brilliant country.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The knowledge
of the Avesta is most accurate in the north-east.
Here we find Airyana Vaeja, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> home or canton
of the Airyas,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> &Ccedil;ughdha (Sogdiana), Bakhdhi (Baktra),
Mouru (Margiana, Merv<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>), Ni&ccedil;a, between Bakhdhi
and Mouru, Haraeva (Haraiva in the inscriptions;
Herat, the land of the Areians), and Vehrkana, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
land of wolves (Hyrcania).<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The furthest point known
to the west is Ragha in Media, which, according
to the Avesta, consists of three citadels or tribes.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
These statements carry us very distinctly to the east
of Iran, the region from Ragha to the Indus. Mouru
is "the high," "the holy," and Bakhdhi's "high
banner" is extolled. In this way this city was no
doubt marked out as the seat of an important dominion,
the centre of a kingdom.</p>

<p>If we might assume that in these fragments of the
sacred books of the Parsees we have not only the
ancient language, but also the ancient religion of
Eastern Iran before us, we might also hope that we
should meet in them with remnants of the tradition,
with native accounts of the fortunes of the country,
enabling us to supplement the scanty information
which we could glean from the inscriptions of the
Assyrians and Darius, and the accounts of Western
writers. Leaving out of sight for the present the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
question, At what period did these writings come
into existence? we may collect what we can find in
them on the early history of Iran.</p>

<p>In the Avesta the god Haoma says, Vivanghana
was the first who crushed out the juice of the Haoma.
As a reward there was born to him the brilliant Yima,
the lord of the nations, the most famous of all who
have seen the sun. While Yima Kshaeta (Yima the
king) reigned there was neither cold nor excessive
heat, neither age nor death, nor envy, caused by the
evil spirits: fathers and sons equally had the vigour
of men of fifty years. Yima caused the means of
support for mankind to be inexhaustible; he liberated
the waters and trees from drought, and the herds from
death.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In an invocation to the goddess Ardvi&ccedil;ura,
the giver of water, to whom Yima sacrifices a hundred
horses, a thousand oxen, and ten thousand head of
small cattle on Hukairya, the summit of the divine
mountain, he prays, "Grant to me, Saviour Ardvi&ccedil;ura,
that I may be the sovereign of all lands, that I may
carry away from the Daevas (the evil spirits) increase
and health, fodder and herds, joy and glory." To the
goddess Ashi vanguhi, Yima also offers a prayer "that
he may bring food and flocks to the creatures of Mazda,
and immortality, and may remove hunger and thirst,
age and death, the hot wind and the cold from the
creatures of Mazda for a thousand years." And the
morning wind, Vayu, is entreated that "Yima may be
the most merciful of all creatures, and that under his
dominion he may make cattle and mankind immortal,
that the waters and trees may never dry up and
wither." In the fragments of the book of the law in
the Avesta, Zarathrustra inquires of Auramazda to
whom he (the god) had first revealed the true doctrine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Auramazda answers, "I spoke first with Yima, the
excellent one. I said to him, Yima, thou beautiful
son of Vivanghana, be thou the preacher and bearer
of my doctrine. But Yima answered, I am not
fitted to be the preacher of the doctrine. Then I,
Auramazda, spoke and said, If thou wilt not obey me,
Yima, to be the bearer of my law, yet make my world
fruitful; be the keeper of my earthly creatures, their
protector and lord. And Yima, the excellent one,
answered, I will cause thy creatures to prosper and
increase; I will be the keeper, protector, and lord
of them. Therefore I, Auramazda, gave to him two
instruments, a golden staff and an ox goad adorned
with gold, and three hundred years passed by. And
the land was full of herds and beasts of draught, of
men, and dogs, and birds, and red flaming fires. And
there was no more any room for the flocks, and men,
and beasts of draught. Then I warned Yima: O
Yima, excellent one, son of Vivanghana, there is no
more any room for the herds, and beasts of draught,
and men. And Yima went forth to meet the stars
and the path of the sun (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> towards the east). He
struck with the golden staff upon the earth, and smote
it with the goad, and said, &Ccedil;penta Armaiti (O holy
earth), arise, part thyself asunder, thou bearer of
animals and of men. And Yima pushed the earth
asunder so that it was a third part greater than before.
Then the flocks found a home, the beasts of draught,
and men, according to their wish and desire." Again
three hundred years passed, and there was no more
any room for herds, beasts, and men; and at Auramazda's
command Yima again caused the earth to
stretch asunder, and it became two-thirds greater
than before; and after another three hundred years
Yima caused the earth to become as large again as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
before.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Then a thousand years passed, and Auramazda
said to Yima, "Bitter cold and sharp frost will fall upon
the earth, and the snow will lie deep on the summits
of the mountains and in the clefts of the valleys. Make
an enclosure (<i>vara</i>) of the length of a horse's course on
each of the four sides. Bring into it a stock of herds
and beasts of draught, of men and dogs, and birds and
red flaming fires, and make the enclosure to be a
dwelling for men and a stall for the cattle. Carry
water thither, and build houses and tombs, and a fortification
and palisade round about, and drive them with
the golden staff into the citadel, and shut to the door.
And Yima made a citadel of the length of a horse's
course. Thither he brought a stock of all men and
women who were the tallest, best, and most beautiful
of earth, and a brood of all animals which were largest,
best, and most beautiful, and the seeds of all fruits and
growths which were best and most beautiful. And he
provided that a pair were ever together. There was no
evil speaking there, nor strife, nor injury, nor deception,
nor meanness; nothing crooked, no mal-formation
of teeth, no crippled form, nor any other of the signs
which are the signs of Angromainyu. In this enclosure
which Yima made men lived the happiest life. A
year was a day, and every forty years two children,
a male and a female, were born from each pair of
human creatures, and so also of each kind of animal."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>In an invocation in the Avesta we are told that
the bright gleaming majesty in the form of the bird
Varaghna had passed from Yima when he began to
love lying speech. Yima fell terrified to earth, and
Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, seized the majesty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
When it passed a second time from Yima, Thraetaona
seized it, and when it passed a third time, Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa
seized it.</p>

<p>The second who crushed the juice of the Haoma
was Athwya. Hence there was born to him a son,
Thraetaona, in the land of Varena. The evil spirit
Angromainyu had created a wicked being, "with
three heads, three throats, six eyes, and a thousand
strengths"&mdash;the Azhi dahaka, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the biting serpent,
which swallowed horses and men, and threatened to
desolate the world. But Thraetaona sacrificed a hundred
horses to Ardvi&ccedil;ura, a thousand oxen, and ten
thousand head of small cattle, and called on the
goddess, and with bound bundle of rods, on Vayu
on his golden throne, with golden footstool and
golden canopy, to grant that he might smite the strong
Druj, which Angromainyu had created as the strongest
to bring death upon the pure world; and he overcame
the monster, because Verethraghna was with him, the
most victorious of mortals.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> And Thraetaona obtained
the splendour of the dominion when it departed a
second time from Yima. In the prayers of the Avesta,
Thraetaona, who has slain the great serpent, is invoked
as helper against the "pain which is caused by the
serpent," against fever and sickness.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The third who crushed the juice of the Haoma for
the sacrifice was Thrita, of the race of &Ccedil;ama. Thrita
was the first who by skill in medicine kept back sickness
and death from the bodies of men. He wished for
means to withstand the pains, the sickness, the death,
the hot and cold fever which Angromainyu had created
for the bodies of men. "Then I, Auramazda, caused
healing plants to grow by hundreds, by thousands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
by tens of thousands around the one Gaokerena." And
in reward for his offering of Haoma two sons were
born to Thrita&mdash;Urvakshaya, who put in order the law,
and Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> having slim horses), the youth
of beautiful form, the bearer of the weapon Gae&ccedil;u.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa smote the poisonous green serpent &Ccedil;ruvara,
on which flowed poison to the thickness of a thumb,
and it swallowed men and horses. Afterwards, after
he had sacrificed to Ardvi&ccedil;ura on the shore of Lake
Pi&ccedil;ano (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, no doubt, in the valley of Pishin in Sejestan),
he smote the giant Gandarewa, who dwelt in Lake
Vourukasha, and the descendants of the nine robbers,
and &Ccedil;navidhaka, who had attempted to overcome
Auramazda and Angromainyu. And when his brother
Urvakshaya had been slain by Hita&ccedil;pa, Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa
besought the wind, who works on high, to grant to
him to slay Hita&ccedil;pa in revenge for the death of his
brother. And he conquered him, and yoked him to
his chariot. When for the third time the majesty
departed from Yima, Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa seized it, the strongest
of men after Zarathrustra. In the prayers of the
Avesta, Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa's help is invoked against robbers
and hostile hosts.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Yima, Thraetaona, Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa, and the forms which
are genealogically connected with them, Vivanghana,
Athwya, &Ccedil;ama, Thrita, and Urvakshaya, are collected
by the Avesta under the name <i>Paradhata</i>, i.&nbsp;e. those
who first exercised dominion.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Indications in our
fragments show that other names were also included<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
in them. Thraetaona's son was Airyu, and Airyu's son
was Manuschithra.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> These most ancient sovereigns were
followed by a second group, whose distinguishing mark
is the surname <i>Kava</i>. The first of these Kavas, whom
the Avesta mentions merely as the wearer of the
divine majesty, is Kava Kavata.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> He is succeeded by
the agile, brilliant Kava U&ccedil;a, who sacrifices to Ardvi&ccedil;ura
on Mount Erezifya in order to obtain the
dominion over all lands, over Daevas and men, wizards
and Pairikas, and this favour the goddess granted him.
After U&ccedil;a the royal majesty united itself, to use the
phrase in the Avesta, with the beautiful pure body of
Kava &Ccedil;yavarshana. He died by a violent death.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
His son was Kava Hu&ccedil;rava, "the brave uniter of the
Arian lands into one kingdom," as the Avesta tells us,
which then goes on to relate that he was without sickness
or death. He had to contend against the destructive
Franghra&ccedil;ianas, the Turanians (<i>tura</i>, <i>tuirya</i>). He besought
Ardvi&ccedil;ura that it "might be granted to him to
put an end to the long dimness, and bind the Franghra&ccedil;ianas
in their abundance and pride." This prayer
the goddess granted. Haoma himself desired "to bind
the destructive, murderous Franghra&ccedil;iana and carry
him away as a captive of the king Hu&ccedil;rava, and that
Kava Hu&ccedil;rava should slay him behind the lake Chaecha&ccedil;ta,
the deep lake with broad waters."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Kava
Hu&ccedil;rava was followed by king Aurvata&ccedil;pa, the son of
Naotara, the son of Manuschithra, the son of Airyu;
and Aurvata&ccedil;pa was succeeded by his son the strong
and warlike Vista&ccedil;pa.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Of the twenty-nine sons of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
king, the Avesta mentions the strong &Ccedil;pentodata, and
informs us that Frashaostra and his brother Jama&ccedil;pa,
of the race of Hvova, were men of importance with the
king. Like Hu&ccedil;rava, Vista&ccedil;pa had to contend with a
Turanian, Arejata&ccedil;pa, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the winner of horses, who
sacrificed to Ardvi&ccedil;ura in order to obtain the victory
over Kava Vista&ccedil;pa and the warrior on horseback,
Zarivairi (the brother of Vista&ccedil;pa). The goddess heard
him not, but heard Vista&ccedil;pa when he sacrificed to her
behind the water of Frazdana, in order to overcome
the hostile Arejata&ccedil;pa, born of darkness, skilled in
evil, who sought to smite the lands of the Arians.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
But Zarathrustra, the son of Pourusha&ccedil;pa, of the
race of Haechata&ccedil;pa, sacrificed to Ardvi&ccedil;ura that
he might unite with the mighty Vista&ccedil;pa, the son of
Aurvata&ccedil;pa, and to Drva&ccedil;pa, "that he might unite
with Hutao&ccedil;a, and she might impress on his memory
the good law."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Zarathrustra proclaimed a new
law, the law of Auramazda. The heroes and kings
before him were known in the Avesta by the name
<i>Paoiryotkaesha</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the men of the earliest custom,
the earliest law.</p>

<p>These are all the traits and pictures of the antiquity
of East Iran, of any importance, which can be
gathered from the remaining fragments of the Avesta.
Of the antiquity and genuineness of the narrative
there is no doubt. The close relationship and coincidence
which they exhibit with the form and views of
the Veda are proved on both sides. As we saw, the
Veda distinguishes the sacrificers and sages of the
ancient time, the earlier time, and the present (IV. 29.)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
The god Haoma is the well-known god Soma of the
Arians in India, the variation in the name being due to
the change of sounds which distinguishes the Old Bactrian
from the language of the Veda. Here, as there,
he is the sacrificial libation, and at the same time the
god who pours the libation, and is its power. The great
heroes Yima, Thraetaona, Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa and Zarathrustra
were born to their fathers as a reward for offering the
libation of Soma. King Yima (Yima Kshaeta) in the
Avesta is no other than the Yama (Yama Rajan) of the
Veda. Yama is the son of Vivasvat, the brilliant, the
shining, the giver of light; and in the Avesta Yima is
the son of Vivanghana. In the Veda he is the assembler
of the people, the first king, the first mortal who shows
to men the way which leads from the depths to the
height of heaven; who first experiences death, but
returns into heaven as the son of the god of light,
where he gathers round him the brave and pious for
new life in imperishable joy (IV. 61). Yima is also the
assembler of men, the first king; he rules with the
golden staff; he founds the religious worship, a merit
which in the Veda belongs to Manu. Under Yima the
earth is filled with red-glowing fires; he worships Vayu
and Ardvi&ccedil;ura. He is the representative of the
golden age; in his reign there is neither heat nor cold,
age nor death, hate nor strife; and his dominion
continues a thousand years. It was the first happy
period of the world, which men passed under the
dominion of the son of the god of light. At what an
elevation Yima must have been placed in the oldest
form of the mythus of East Iran is clear from the
fact that creative acts and the triple extension of the
earth are ascribed to him. After the close of this
golden period, winter comes upon the earth, heat and
cold, strife, sickness, and death. The happy life of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the golden age only continues within certain limits, in
the enclosure of Yima, where he carries on the blessed
and immortal life with selected men, trees, animals, and
food. Here Yima is to live till the end of all things,
when his companions will again people the earth. As
in this garden of Yima the sun, moon, and stars shine
together,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> it must be sought in the sky, or at any rate
on the bright, divine mountain Hukairya, where there
is neither night nor gloom, and which is at the same
time described as Yima's place of sacrifice.</p>

<p>If the Indians have placed the old Arian legend of
a golden age on earth in the days of Yima's reign,
they have also, after their manner, depicted his heavenly
kingdom with brighter colours, while among the
Iranians this part of the legend is combined with the
heavenly garden into which Yima receives the men he
has selected as the best. Nevertheless, a reminiscence
of Yima's garden has remained beyond the Indus in
the story of the Uttara Kurus, who dwell beyond the
holy mountains to the north.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The most striking variation from the common Arian
myth in the Avesta is the statement that Yima is
subordinate to a deity, Auramazda, of whom the Arians
of India knew nothing. The old legend is thus brought
within the sphere of new views, which must have exer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>cised
still further influence upon it. It is Auramazda
who places in the hand of Yima the control, superintendence,
and protection of animals and men. It is
not through Yima's own desire, as was certainly the
case in the old legend, but at Auramazda's bidding,
that the enclosure is made, and the selected men,
animals, and trees brought into it. The main reason
for this change was the necessity of giving an answer
to the question, Why did not the golden age continue?
and if, long after Yima, Zarathrustra proclaimed
a new and better law, why had not Auramazda revealed
this law to the favoured Yima? In order to answer
this riddle, the Avesta represents Auramazda as asking
Yima to become "the preacher and bearer of his
doctrine," and Yima refuses to accept this mission.
Hence Yima becomes guilty of a fault, and a reason is
given why the golden age, the thousand years of the
reign of Yima, came to an end. Without the good
doctrine, the invasion of evil spirits, and with them
of heat and cold, sickness and death, strife and blight,
could not be kept back from the earth. This trait of
the guilt of Yima, which is entirely unknown to the
earlier legend, is carried out still further. According
to the prayer in the Avesta (p. 34) blessing and
immortality continued in the kingdom of Yima, "till he
began to love lying speech." When he had rejected
Auramazda's law he cannot himself resist the seduction
of evil spirits. The first offence brings on the second,
and this causes the triple loss of majesty, which at
length ends in the fall and violent death of Yima, an
incident already indicated in the Avesta.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> How this
form of the legend allowed the garden of Yima to be
placed on the divine mountain, and whether the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
contradiction was removed or not, our fragments do
not enable us to decide.</p>

<p>In the Veda it was Indra who had to contend
against Vritra and Ahi, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the serpents, and the
black spirits, which desired to drink up the water of the
sky and veil its light. In Iran, as we shall see, this
office is transferred to other spirits, and also to Thraetaona.
The Azhi dahaka of the Avesta is the Ahi
of the Veda. Ahi and Azhi are the same word, with
the same meaning; the addition <i>dahaka</i> refers to the
destructive power of this demon. Verethraghna, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
the slayer of Vritra, stands in the Avesta at the side
of Thraetaona in his struggle with Azhi (p. 35), and
the morning wind supports him just as in the Veda
the winds assist Indra against Ahi and Vritra. Among
the Indians, Traitana is a spirit of the air, who
dwells in the remotest regions of the sky, who hews
off the head of a giant from his shoulders, and in the
Veda, Trita, the son of Aptya, drinks the draught of
Soma, in order to win strength for the slaying of
Vritra; he slays the snake with three heads and seven
tails; with his iron club he splits the hollows in the
rock in which the demons have hidden the cows of the
heaven (the rain clouds).<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> In the Veda, Aptya is the
father of Trita; in the Avesta, Athwya is the father
of Thraetaona. Of Trita, whom it represents as sprung
from &Ccedil;ama, the Avesta declares that he was the first
physician; in the Veda we are told of Trita he knew
how to heal sickness as the gods had taken his sickness
from him; that he bestowed long life.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The two
figures of Trita and Traitana gradually unite in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Veda; in the Avesta, Thrita and Thraetaona remain
separate persons. The Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa of the Avesta seems
to correspond to the Kri&ccedil;a&ccedil;va of the Indians, whom we
first find in the Epos, where he is celebrated as a
warlike Rishi.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>If the Paradhatas, Yima, Athwya, Thraetaona,
Thrita, and Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa in the original conception are
spirits of the sky, if the monsters with which Thraetaona
and Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa struggle are not to be sought
on earth but in the heavens, if in these dragons
we find once more the cloud-serpents, against which
Indra and his company have to contend&mdash;we do not at
once set foot upon earth, when we come to the Kavanians.
According to the later tradition of Iran, Kava
Kavata was fetched from the divine mountain in order
to reign over the country; two white falcons bring
him a golden crown. The Rigveda mentions Kavya
U&ccedil;anas, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> U&ccedil;anas, the son of Kavi, who brings the
cows of the sky, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the clouds, to the pasture.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> In
the Avesta, Kava U&ccedil;a sacrifices not only to rule over
the whole earth but also over the spirits. According
to a later tradition this sovereign&mdash;now called Kai
Kaus&mdash;causes beautiful castles to be built on the divine
mountain by the demons, and is then carried by four
eagles into heaven. Kava Hu&ccedil;rava, for whom in the
Avesta the god Haoma contends, is without sickness
and death (p. 37). In the later tradition, in which he is
known as Kai Chosru, he begins a pilgrimage to heaven
after conquering and slaying his opponent the Turanian
Frangha&ccedil;iana, like the sons of Pandu in the Mahabharata
after their victory over the Kurus and their happy
reign. Like them also, Kai Chosru climbs the mountains
and disappears from his companions at a well. Against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
his command they seek him in the mountains, and are
all buried in a great snow-storm. From the name
Manuschithra (p. 37), <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> scion of Manu, we may
conclude that the twin brother of Yama, "father
Manu," was not unknown to the Arians of Iran.
But the genealogy in which the Avesta has preserved
these names has no greater claims to historical value
than the figures which have passed in review before us.
Airyu is the son of Thraetaona; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> from the mightiest
hero, the slayer of the great dragon, are sprung the
sovereigns and the nation of the Airyas; the son of
Airyu is Manuschithra; from whose son, Naotara,
are derived the two last Kavas, Aurvata&ccedil;pa and
Vista&ccedil;pa.</p>

<p>If the coincidence of the forms from Yima to
Kava Hu&ccedil;rava with the Veda is a proof of the
antiquity and genuineness of the tradition of the
Avesta, the gain for history becomes less instead of
greater. No one would take mythical persons for
historical. Yet the style and form in which we
find these traditional statements in the fragments of
the Avesta supply certain guides for the lost history
of Eastern Iran. The splendour of the royal majesty
is so often and so distinctly brought into prominence,
that the conclusion forces itself upon us, that the
regions in which the Avesta arose, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the north-east
of Iran, must have been acquainted with a powerful
and highly-respected monarchy. The ancient spirits
of the sky are changed in the Avesta into mighty
warriors and far-ruling kings, a circumstance in favour
of the supposition that an empire once existed here, the
image of which is reflected on prehistoric times. It is
in Epic poems that the spirits of the first sky become
heroes, and Epic poetry only arises in and follows on
periods of war and conflict. The fact that the forms of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the spirits thus changed into heroes by Epic song are
turned into the forefathers of the kings and progenitors
of the nation, further establishes the conclusion
that a military monarchy must have been in existence
here; only warlike princes could appear as the heirs
of heroes. Moreover, the Avesta extols the high
banner of Bakhdhi and speaks of the neighbouring
regions as favoured; the later tradition of Iran marks
out Bactria very clearly as the abode of Aurvata&ccedil;pa
and Vista&ccedil;pa; in the third century <small>B.C.</small> Bactria
supplied its princes with means not merely to achieve
their own independence, but to maintain it against
the great kingdom of the Seleucids and to subjugate
the land of the Indus (p. 25 ff.); and if, in addition to
these facts, we bear in mind the conceptions found in
the Median poems of the great power of the kings of
the Bactrians, their treasures in gold and silver, their
fortified city, the conquest of which was the greatest
achievement of Ninus&mdash;we may venture to assume
that before the days of the Medes, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> before the
year 650 <small>B.C.</small>, there must have existed an important
monarchy in the north-east of Iran.</p>

<p>With the assistance of the Avesta we may go
a step further. We saw that Kava Hu&ccedil;rava no less
than Vista&ccedil;pa is represented as fighting against the
Turas or Tuiryas. Who were these enemies? In
Old-Bactrian the word means the enemy, the oppressor.
Strabo speaks of a region of Turuia in the
north of Parthia, towards the steppes of the Oxus.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> In
the later tradition of Iran the Turanians are the
constant and most dangerous enemies of the kings of
Bactria. The steppes of the Oxus and Jaxartes were
inhabited by nations to whom the Persians gave the
collective name of Sac&aelig;, while the Greeks called them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>Scythians. They found but scanty pasture on the
steppes, and it was natural that they should look with
longing eyes on the more fertile regions of Bactria and
Sogdiana. It has already been mentioned how careful
Cyrus was to protect these countries, when he had
conquered them, against the nations of the steppes.
At a later time, from the middle of the second century
<small>B.C.</small> downwards (p. 28), we have definite information
of the pressure of these nations on Parthia, Margiana,
and Bactria. When freed from the attacks of the
Seleucids on the west, the Arsacids had to defend the
east of the kingdom. Phraates II. and Artabanus II.
fell in battle against the nomads; Mithridates II.
succeeded in protecting Parthia, but about the year 100
<small>B.C.</small> the Sac&aelig; were able to force a way through
Bactria. They possessed themselves of the best land
in the east of Iran, the valleys of the Hilmend (p. 7),
bequeathed their name to the country (Sikashtan,
Sejestan), and from the valley of the Cabul extended
their dominion beyond the Indus. The white
Huns, or Yu&euml;chis, followed the Sac&aelig;; and they also
reached the Indus. Is there any reason to doubt the
Avesta that even before the Medes and Cyrus the
princes of Bactria and Sogdiana were occupied with
beating back the tribes of the steppes?</p>

<p>In ancient times, as Strabo tells us, the Bactrians
and Sogdiani were little removed from wandering
shepherds. The Avesta exhibits them in close connection
with horses. The names compounded with <i>a&ccedil;pa</i>
(horse) are common; Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa, Aurvata&ccedil;pa, Vista&ccedil;pa,
Haechata&ccedil;pa, Jama&ccedil;pa, Pourusha&ccedil;pa. Of Zaria&ccedil;pa and
the Zaria&ccedil;pians we have already spoken. The most
important source of wealth must have consisted in
horses, for which the mountains supplied ample pasture.
The horse-sacrifice is the chief sacrifice of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Avesta. One hundred horses were equal to 1000
oxen, and 10,000 head of small cattle. We found
that Bactria could furnish the last Darius with 30,000
cavalry, and the horse was the symbol of Bactria on
the coins of the Greek princes of the land (p. 27).</p>

<p>From all these indications we may assume that when
the Arians had settled in Margiana, Bactria, and Sogdiana,
and agriculture became of importance beside
the breeding of cattle, the necessity of protection
against the migratory tribes of the endless plains
stretching to the north, created among the Arians a
warlike nobility who took upon themselves the duty
of defence. The valley of the Zarefshan (Sogdiana), the
terrace of Bactria, the region of Merv, became in the
hands of the Arians advanced posts of civilisation in
the desert. If Western Iran was protected in the north
by the Alps of Aderbeijan and the Caspian Sea against
attacks from that quarter, Eastern Iran lay open to
the nomads of the steppes, and had nothing but arms
to defend its cultivated lands. We have already seen
that Bactria even in the sixth century had passed
beyond the earliest stages of civilisation (p. 24). But
even a less degree of prosperity was sufficient to excite
the sons of the desert to invasion. Hence we may
assume that the incursions and raids of the nomads of
the steppes began with the increase of the flocks and
the prosperity of agriculture in the valleys of Merv,
Bactria, and Sogdiana. The increasing severity of these
attacks compelled the Bactrian soldiery to collect their
forces for more successful resistance, and to place the
best warriors at the head of the community. Thus it
was not by spontaneous development, but rather by
the opposition to the nations of the steppes, that the
north-east of Iran first outgrew the tribal life, and
became transformed into a larger state. Of this king<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>dom
Aurvata&ccedil;pa and Vista&ccedil;pa became the rulers; in
the Avesta they are distinguished from the Paradhatas
and from Kava Kavata, Kava U&ccedil;a, and Kava Hu&ccedil;rava,
by a new addition to the name and other peculiar
traits, and form a third group. The progress of our
investigation will show that the formation of this
Bactrian kingdom cannot be placed later than 1100
<small>B.C.</small>; the date of Vista&ccedil;pa must be put about 1000
<small>B.C.</small>, and it was the successors of Vista&ccedil;pa who sent to
Shalmanesar II. the tribute of camels with two humps,
and yaks (about 850 <small>B.C.</small>), who found themselves
menaced once more by the advances of Tiglath Pilesar
II. to Arachosia in the year 745 <small>B.C.</small>, and at length
succumbed to Cyrus. We shall find that this kingdom
was not without its warlike races and priestly families,
that Zaria&ccedil;pa and Bactria were the centres of it, and
that the sovereigns attained despotic power. Yet the old
warlike families must have preserved a certain importance
under the monarchy, unless they regained it when
lost under the viceroys of the Ach&aelig;menids. It was
the chieftains of the Bactrians whom Alexander summoned
to Zaria&ccedil;pa, and who with the Sogdiani at their
side took the lead in resistance. The most powerful
of them stubbornly defended their rocky citadels
against the Macedonians.</p>

The statement in the Bundehesh that Airyana Vaeja was situated beside
Atropatene is, however, of very little weight against the fact that the
Arians of East Iran are nearest to the Arians of India. I shall return
to this point below. The remark in Stephanus, "&#7944;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#945;, a nation

unsuited to give rise to the legend of a flood. Nor is there any question
of the destruction of evil men (if there had been, Yima would have
been the most guilty and the least deserving of pardon), but of the end
of the golden age, as is shown in the Vendidad, the Ya&ccedil;na, and the
Yashts: the earth becomes more thickly peopled, men and animals do
not grow old or die. If we must bring together things which have
really no relation to each other, it would be more apposite to compare
the paradise of the Hebrews. The reason for the end of the golden age
is the guilt of Yima. [Cf. Kuenen, "Religion of Israel," 3, c. 9, E. T.]</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE SCRIPTURES OF IRAN.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></h3>


<p>The statements of the Avesta concerning the ancient
rulers of Eastern Iran were proved to be without historical
value, yet we found in them an ancient and
genuine tradition, the form of which allowed us to draw
certain conclusions about the political condition of that
region in a period for which we have no other records
except the poetry of Western Iran. But what the Avesta
tells us of the rulers of ancient days is of secondary
importance for the book, which comprises the doctrines
and ordinances of the faith proclaimed by Zarathrustra,
and the rules of life which he is said to have laid
down. May we assume that we possess these in a
genuine and unaltered form in the Avesta, though
they have only come down to us in fragments?</p>

<p>A book of the Parsees of India, which tells the story
of their flight from their ancient home, relates that
Iskander (Alexander of Macedon) burned the revealed
scriptures, and the faithful were persecuted for 300
years. When Ardeshir (the first Sassanid) ascended
the throne, the true faith was restored, under the
superintendence of Arda Viraf. After this the true
religion was again suspended till king Shapur (Shapur
II.) rose and once more made the faith famous, and Aderbat
Mahresfant girded his loins in the good cause. The
same account is given in the Book of Arda Viraf, also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>a book of the Parsees of India. From this we learn
that the religion received by the pious Zarathrustra
lasted for 300 years in purity. Then the evil one stirred
up Iskander Rumi, so that he spread war and devastation
over Iran, and slew the rulers of the land. The
Avesta which was preserved at Stakhar Papakan (Persepolis),
written on cow-skins with golden ink, he burned,
and put to death many priests and judges, pillars of the
faith, and spread hatred, strife, and confusion among
the people of Iran. They had now no lord, guide,
and high priest, who knew their religion; they were
full of doubts and had different modes of belief and
worship of various kinds, and different laws prevailed
in the world till the time when Ardeshir came to the
throne and listened to the words of the holy Arda
Viraf and believed him. But after Ardeshir's death
a schism broke out, and more than 40,000 souls
fell away from the true faith, till the day when the
holy Aderbat Mahresfant arose.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> An older writing
of the Parsees, the Dinkart (composed under the
Sassanids), tells us, apparently on the ground of a
proclamation of the Sassanid Chosru Parvez (590-627
<small>A.D.</small>) that king Vista&ccedil;pa of Bactria had commanded
that all books which were written in the language of
the Magians should be collected, in order that the faith
of the worshippers of Auramazda might have some
support, and all men were to go to Frashaostra (whom
the Avesta mentions as a companion of Zarathrustra)
to be instructed in the faith. And Darai, the son of
Darai (Darius Hystaspis is meant), commanded that
two copies of the entire Avesta, precisely as Zarathrustra
had received it from Auramazda, should be
preserved, the one in the treasury at Shapikan, and
the other in the city of scriptures. Then Valkosh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
(Vologeses), the descendant of Ashkan (Arsaces),
gave orders that so much of the Avesta as had
escaped destruction and the ravages of Iskander and
the warriors of Rum, and existed in fragments or
in oral tradition, should be sought out and brought
from every city. And king Artakshatr (Ardeshir)
summoned the Herbedh (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the priest)<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Tosar with
the holy scriptures, which were scattered, to his residence,
and when Tosar came he gave command to the
other priests that everything, which differed from that
which was now considered to be knowledge and
wisdom, should be suppressed. The son of Artakshatr,
Shapuhar (241-272 <small>A.D.</small>), the king of kings, gave
command that all writings on medicine or astronomy
or other subjects in Hindostan, Rum, and other lands,
should be collected, and again united with the Avesta,
and that an exact copy should be deposited in the
treasury of Shapikan. Lastly Atropat (Aderbat) in
the reign of Shapuhar (Shapur II, 309-379 <small>A.D.</small>),
the son of Auharmazdi, purified the sayings of Zarathrustra
and enumerated the Nosks (chapters) of the
sacred scriptures.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>In the rivayats of the Parsees in India, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the
collections of the sayings of the priests on their
doctrine, we find an enumeration of these sections
of the scriptures. At each book this list notes how
many chapters were re-discovered "after Alexander."
According to this enumeration the scriptures of Iran
consisted of twenty-one books.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The first book contained
the songs of praise to the supreme spirits in 33
chapters; the second (22 chapters) treated of good

<p>According to this list the scriptures of Iran must
have been of very considerable extent. The Arabian
author Masudi, who lived about the middle of the
tenth century <small>A.D.</small>, also puts the number of books at
twenty-one. "Zartusht," he says, "gave the Parsees
the book which is called the Avesta. It consisted of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
twenty-one sections, of which each amounted to 200
pages. This book was written in the character which
Zartusht invented and which the Magians call the
religious character, on 12,000 cow-hides, and these
were kept together by bands of gold. It was composed
in the old Persian language, which no one now understands."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
From the list of the books and chapters it
is clear that these writings comprised not only the
religious doctrine and law, together with the rules for
correct conversation, but also the rubrics for the liturgy
and ritual. They were at the same time the code of
criminal and civic law, and in them was deposited
what was known of medicine and agriculture, and the
sum total of the science of their authors.</p>

<p>Can we assume that writings of this importance,
nature, and extent existed in Iran before Alexander of
Macedon overthrew the kingdom of the Ach&aelig;menids?
Herodotus tells us that the Magians or priests of the
Persians recited the theogony, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> long poems, at their
sacrifices. The disciples of the sophist Prodicus are
said to have asserted that they were in possession of
writings of Zoroaster, who taught the Persians their
religion.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Hermippus of Smyrna, who wrote in the
second half of the third century <small>B.C.</small>, and devoted
especial attention to the religions of the east, stated
that the Magians maintained two principles, a good
and an evil deity; the one they called Zeus and Oromasdes,
the other Hades and Areimanius.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Zoroaster,
who founded the doctrine of the Magians, had composed
twenty books, each of 100,000 lines, and Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>mippus
gave the contents of the various books and
quoted regulations from them. Pliny tells us: "The
doctrine of the Magians prevails to this day among a
great part of the nations, and in the East is supreme
over the king of kings" (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Arsacids); and
vouches for Hermippus that he had written with great
care about the Magians,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> from whose work no doubt he
quotes some particulars of the doctrine of Zoroaster.
According to Zoroaster's rule the sowing of the fields
should take place when the moon is in the sign of
Taurus; and it was forbidden to expose the person
before the sun or moon, or to defile a man's shadow.
Pliny also mentions the precious stones, of which
Zoroaster had extolled the brilliance; the herbs, used
by the Magians; and enumerates a number of remedies,
which they applied. Finally, he speaks of the
Nyktegertos, a herb growing in Gedrosia, which the
Magians used when making vows.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Philo of Byblus
quotes a passage, apparently from "the sacred collection
of Zoroaster," on the nature of the deity, and
assures us that the Persian Osthanes maintained the
same in the Octateuch.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Plutarch gives us a short
but accurate account of the system of Zoroaster; his
contemporary Dio Chrysostom asserts that Zoroaster
and the sons of the Magians had sung of the balance of
Zeus and the constellation of the day in strains more
sublime than those of Homer or Hesiod;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and Pausanias
relates that at the kindling of the sacrificial fire the
invocation was sung by the Magians from a book in a
barbarous language wholly unintelligible to the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>This evidence from the West confirms the existence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of sacred writings in Iran after the time of Alexander,
and also indicates that they existed previously to
that date; it contradicts the story of their destruction
by the Macedonians. The books must have been
in existence when Hermippus could speak of their
extent, and quote rules from them; and writings of
the kind must have been known when, in the days
of Pausanias, the Magians could sing their invocations
from a book. From other sources we are sufficiently
informed that Alexander's efforts were not directed
towards destroying the national character and traditional
religion of the Persians. Arrian tells us that
Magians no less than Greek soothsayers took part
in their festivals.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Nor were the Seleucids more
desirous than Alexander to effect the destruction of
the Iranian nationality; just as the Ptolemies never
attempted to set aside the Egyptian religion and life.
Even if they had cherished such views, they were far
from being strong enough to carry them out, for the
Greek empire over Iran lasted in its integrity only
eighty years. The Arsacids also, who recovered Iran
from the Seleucids, were not averse to the Greek
nation. They called themselves friends of the Hellenes,
and not only was Greek spoken, but even the tragedies
of Euripides were acted at their courts. The
scanty remains of the monuments present us with
echoes of Greek;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> their coins, with few exceptions,
bear Greek legends like those of the Bactrian princes
whom they overcame. But though the influence of the
Hellenic character continued under the Arsacids, and
at the same time the Aram&aelig;an language and manners<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
obtained even greater recognition than Hellenism
during their dominion, the reign of the Arsacids was a
restoration and revivification of the Iranian nationality.
According to the evidence of western writers the
Magians together with the members of the royal race
formed the council of the Arsacids.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Pliny has already
told us that these princes obeyed the rules of the
Magians, and we also find that they invoked Mithra
as the Ach&aelig;menids had done, and "saluted the sun."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
Like the Ach&aelig;menids, too, they would not permit
their armies to fight by night, and we are told that
in their time the greatest weight was given to the
love of truth and fidelity, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to the virtues which,
according to Herodotus, the Persians of his time considered
the most important, and on which the Avesta
insists above all others.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> We also learn from western
writers that the founder of the kingdom (Arsaces I.)
was a descendant of Phriapites (Friyapaiti), and with
his brother Tiridates and five others he slew the satrap
of Antiochus Theos, and drove out the Macedonians;<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
just as Darius with the six Persian princes overthrew
the dominion of Gaumata; and the Arabs relate that
the Arsacids trace back their stock to &Ccedil;yavarshana,
the son of Kava U&ccedil;a, a story which cannot have been
invented in Arabia.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In the list of the Arsacids we
also find the name Chosru (108-130 <small>A.D.</small>), the Kava
Hu&ccedil;rava of the old legend (p. 37); on the coins we
find a Vologeses and a Phraates before the fire-altar,
the characteristic symbol of the ancient worship of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Iran. Just as the old Arian character appears beside
the Greek on the coins of the Greek princes of
Bactria, the Greek character on the coins of the
Arsacids gradually degenerates until at length it gives
way to a new Iranian character and language. The
tradition sketched in the Dinkart, as we have seen,
represents the Arsacid Vologeses (which of the four
princes of the name is meant is not clear)<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> as collecting
what fragments remained of the holy scriptures
in the memory of the priests. The burning of the
scriptures by Alexander, as related in the books
of the Parsees on their exodus and the Arda Viraf,
is merely a transference to him of the conduct of
the Moslems on their conquest of Iran. Of the
continuance of the ancient religion of Iran under
the Arsacids there can be no doubt, though it is true
that along with it, in the Greek cities which Alexander
and the Seleucids founded, and which were
independent within their walls even under the Parthians,
Hellenic rites were practised. In these cities
Syrian modes of worship were also permitted, and the
Aramaic language and culture found entrance into
Iran.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>In the land of Persia, among the Persians whom
Mithridates I. subjugated to the dominion of the
Arsacids, reminiscences of the ancient time, of the
splendour and glory of the Ach&aelig;menids, were naturally
more lively than in Parthia, which was formerly subject
to the Persians, and now under the Arasacids stood at
the head of Iran. In Persia, Artakshatr (Ardeshir),
the son of Papaki, the grandson of Sassan, rebelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
against king Artabanus IV. In three great battles
the Persians contended with the Parthians; the latter
were conquered, and Artabanus fell, and with him the
kingdom of the Arsacids after a continuance of 476
years (225 <small>A.D.</small>). With the reign of Ardeshir began
a more energetic restoration of Iran. He and his
successors after him revered the memory of the Ach&aelig;menids,
and strove to continue their achievements<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>.
We again hear of seven houses, and seven princes who
had the right to wear diadems beside the king, like
the seven tribal princes of the old Persian kingdom;<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
we find the fire-altar before the tent of the Sassanids
as well as the Ach&aelig;menids; and in the army of the
Sassanids, no less than in that of Darius and Xerxes,
was a troop of "immortals." Ardeshir, like the founder
of the Persian empire, caused a portrait of himself on
horseback to be cut in a rock-wall to the north-west
of Persepolis (Naksh-i-Rustem) in remembrance of the
achievements which established his kingdom&mdash;the rock
on which 700 years before Darius had marked his
tomb by a portrait and inscription. The inscription
under this portrait (in the Pehlevi of East and West
Iran, with a Greek translation) runs thus: "Portrait of
the worshipper of Mazda, the god Artakshatr (Artaxares
in the Greek), the king of kings of the Arians
(of the kings of Airan, in the Pehlevi texts), the scion
of the sky (<i>minu chitri</i>), the son of the god Papaki,
the king."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Ardeshir's son, Shapur I. (241-272 <small>A.D.</small>),
caused his victory over Valerian and his capture of
the emperor to be recorded on the same rock; we see
Shapur on horseback, and Valerian kneeling before
him, a representation which recurs at the old Persian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
city of Darabgerd. At Naksh-i-Rejeb, between the
rock-wall of Naksh-i-Rustem and Mount Nachmed, on
which abutted Persepolis, the proud citadel of the
Ach&aelig;menids, and in the grotto of Haiyabad, we
find in the one case a portrait of Shapur, and
in the other inscriptions which mention this ruler
and king Varahran. At Kermanshah, on the western
side of Mount Behistun, on the eastern side of which
mountain Darius inscribed the proudest memorial of
his achievements, we see king Ardeshir, and beneath
him the corpse of Artabanus; behind the king is
Mithra with the club which gave him victory, and
before him Auramazda who presents the ring of empire
to Ardeshir. Not far from this portrait Shapur II.
(309-379 <small>A.D.</small>) caused a grotto to be excavated in the
rock. In the sculpture of this cave we see the goddess
Anahita, who presents to the king the ring of empire;
at some distance are the hunting expeditions of the
king; a second grotto close to this exhibits the pictures
of king Auharmazdi II., the father of Shapur II., and
of Shapur III. his second successor.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>Though the Sassanids sought to restore the kingdom
of the Ach&aelig;menids, and immortalise their own achievements
beside those of the early kings, the religious
revival which they undertook was far more thorough
than the political. In this direction they went further
than the Ach&aelig;menids; they caused the forms which
the old faith of Iran had retained and forced on the
East, to be current throughout the whole kingdom.
Agathias assures us that Ardeshir was eagerly devoted
to the study of the doctrine of the Magians, who
since his accession had gained an importance such
as they never enjoyed before. The business of the
State was decided upon their advice and predictions;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
they assisted individual persons in their private matters
and suits at law, and the Persians did not regard anything
as legal and right which was not confirmed by a
Magian.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> At the head of the Magians, we are told in
another account coming from a western source, a Grand
Magian was placed under the Sassanids,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and as a fact
the Magians now received a thorough organisation.
At the head of their caste was the High Magian
(<i>Magupat</i>, Mobedh); and over all the High Magians
was the Grand Magian (<i>Magupatan magupat</i>); to the
Magians belonged the judicial power; and the Grand
Magian performed the coronation of the king. The
Sassanids erected fire-temples in Persia no less than
in Aderbeijan; their coins always exhibit the fire-altar,
and as a rule two priests before it. They carried
their genealogy beyond Sassan through &Ccedil;pentodata
(p. 38) to Vista&ccedil;pa of Bactria, who is now said to
have established the seven princes; they call themselves
by the names of the ancient heroes who met us
in the Avesta; Kavadh (Kava Kavata) and Chosru
(Kava Hu&ccedil;rava). While styling themselves the worshippers
of Mazda (Auramazda) like the founders of
their empire, they went so far as to assume the names
of the gods of the Avesta; some even called themselves
after Verethraghna (Varahran, Bahram), others Auharmazdi
after Auramazda himself. The numerous Christians
on the Euphrates and Tigris as well as in Armenia
had to undergo severe persecutions; especially under
Shapur II., Varahran V., and Yezdegerd II. (438-457
<small>A.D.</small>), whose viceroy declared to the Armenian Christians
that the Daevas (Dews) of Ahriman had deceived
them; it was not the good God who had created evil
and death but the wicked spirit. Defection from the
faith of Auramazda was punished with death. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
treaties of the years 422, 533, and 563 <small>A.D.</small> Theodosius
II. and Justinian obtained the concession that
the Christians in the kingdom of the Sassanids should
not be compelled to conform to the rules of the
Magians; they were to be at liberty to bury their
dead,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> whereas the doctrine of Zarathrustra required
that the corpses should be exposed.</p>

<p>As such was the attitude of the house of the
Sassanids, we may believe the books of the Parsees
that Ardeshir eagerly took in hand the revival of the
true faith, and that he was assisted in this by competent
Magians; by Arda Viraf, according to the book
of the Exodus and of Arda Viraf (p. 50); according
to the Dinkart, by the Herbedh Tosar. The book of
Arda Viraf relates at length how he fell asleep in the
assembly of priests before Ardeshir, and his soul was
carried by the god &Ccedil;raosha through heaven and hell.
And when the Dinkart represents a standard of true
religion as being set up under Ardeshir, there is no
reason to doubt the statement. After the reign of
Ardeshir, we are told in the Book of the Exodus, the
true religion was again suspended, or, as the Book of
Arda Viraf tells us, a schism arose. The cause of this
division is sufficiently known from other sources. In
the reign of Shapur I. (241-272 <small>A.D.</small>) a native of
Ctesiphon, of the name of Mani, came forward with a
new doctrine which attempted to mingle Chald&aelig;an,
Jewish, and Christian elements in the faith of Iran,
and to resolve it into abstractions. He found numerous
adherents.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Varahran II. (276-293 <small>A.D.</small>) allowed him
to dispute with the Magians, and then put him to
death. Under Shapur II., who succeeded his father
Auharmazdi II. as a posthumous child (309-379 <small>A.D.</small>),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
in order to check Manicheism and the advance of
Christianity, it was necessary to go back to the principles
of the old faith, and to invigorate these by the
collection and establishment of the sacred scriptures.
We may therefore have the fullest confidence in accepting
from these three books of the Parsees the facts
that Shapur "made the sacred faith to be famous;"
that Aderbat, whose work under Shapur is confirmed
by Hamza of Isfahan, collected the scriptures, purified
the sayings of Zarathrustra, and enumerated the chapters.
It is on this redaction of the canon by Aderbat
Mahresfant under Shapur II. that the list of the books
and chapters rests, distinguishing what were originally
in existence and what were then preserved. What was
not discovered "after Alexander" means what was not
discovered or not accepted at this redaction. Instead of
the 815 chapters which the Avesta is said to have previously
contained, the new canon amounted to only
348 chapters. That Aderbat was the founder of this
canon is clear not only from the epithet which the
books of the Parsees give him (Mahresfant, Old Bactrian
Manthra&ccedil;penta, meaning "the sacred word,") but
also from the confession of faith still in use among the
Parsees: "I abide in the law which Zarathrustra
taught to Vista&ccedil;pa, to Frashaostra, to Jama&ccedil;pa, and
&Ccedil;pentodata, which came in the succession of generations
to Aderbat, who duly corrected and purified it."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
It was shown above that the language of the sacred
books thus again collected was that of Eastern Iran
(p. 30). When Aderbat revised the canon it had
long ceased to be spoken. But there were already
translations of the sacred books into the later forms
which the language of Iran had received in the time
of the Parthians, or at any rate such translations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
were made after the revision of the canon.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Masudi
informed us that the Avesta was composed in the old
Persian language, which at that time (tenth century
<small>A.D.</small>) was no longer understood. Ibn Haukal, who
travelled in Persia in the same century, tells us: "In
Fars three languages are in use; the Farsi, in which
the inhabitants converse with each other; the Pehlevi,
which was the language of the ancient Persians, and
in which the Magians wrote their historical books, but
which in our time is no longer understood by the
inhabitants of Fars without a translation; and the
Arabian.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>" When Aderbat revised the Avesta in the
middle of the fourth century <small>B.C.</small>, the Parsi (Farsi), <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
the later Middle Persian, was still in formation; the
older Middle Persian or Pehlevi was still intelligible,
but translations of the Avesta into this language did
not make clear to every one the meaning of the ancient
language in which the scriptures were composed. In
the time of the Parthian empire the old mode of
writing was given up in the West as well as in the
East of Iran, and exchanged for new methods. In the
West a cuneiform character derived from the writing of
Babylon and Assyria had been adopted; the East used
the Arian alphabet. Under the Arsacids the Pehlevi
became common. Like the old Persian cuneiform
this is borrowed from a Semitic pattern. The chief city
of the Parthians lay on the Tigris in the midst of a
Semitic population. The cursive character of the
Aram&aelig;ans, as we find it on the coins of the satraps of
the Ach&aelig;menids of the fourth century <small>B.C.</small>, with a few
modifications, forms the base of the Pehlevi; and the
earlier shapes of this character are seen in the coins of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the Arsacids of the first century <small>A.D.</small> But it is not
the character which forms the peculiar mark of Pehlevi.
Along with the Aramaic letters the Parthians took the
Aramaic vocabulary; they wrote the Aramaic word
instead of the Persian, and to this they attached the
termination or case-ending of the corresponding Persian
word; the reader must understand Aramaic and substitute
the Persian word for the Aramaic when reading.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
Hence Pehlevi was in reality a secret mode of
writing, intended exclusively for the learned, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> for
the priests. It is a proof of the close connection
between the priests of the East and West that this
character, which arose in the West out of the contact
with the Aramaic population on the Euphrates and
Tigris, spread to the East also and was adopted by the
scholars there. Nor was this all. The variations in
the Eastern dialect brought about certain modifications
in the forms of the letters, and thus there arose
an Eastern alphabet of Pehlevi beside the Western
alphabet. When Ardeshir destroyed the empire of the
Parthians in the year 226 <small>A.D.</small> these two alphabets were
in existence. The Eastern alphabet finally triumphed
over the Western. It became the royal mode of
writing, and as such was used on the coins. The letters
in the manuscripts of the Pehlevi translation of the
Avesta in the possession of the Parsees agree throughout
with the characters on the legends of the coins of the
Sassanids about the year 600 <small>A.D.</small><a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The characters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
also, in which the text of the Avesta is written in the
manuscripts of the Parsees, belong to the later East-Pehlevi
alphabet, which, owing to the greater wealth
of the old Bactrian alphabet in sounds, especially in
vowels, possesses a greater number of letters.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The
coincidence of the letters in the manuscripts of the
Parsees with those on the coins of the later Sassanids,
proves beyond contradiction that although the oldest
existing manuscripts belong to the fourteenth century
of our era,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> they are nevertheless true copies of the
characters in which the Avesta was written in the last
century of the empire of the Sassanids.</p>

<p>All that the Parsees of India now possess are some
not very extensive remains of the revision of the
sacred scriptures made in the reign of Shapur II.
The existing part of the laws corresponds in the title, the
divisions and their arrangements, with the twentieth
book of the text (p. 52). It contains the rubrics for
purification, for repelling and removing the evil spirits.
The title is the Vend&icirc;dad, or, in the older form, the
Vidaevodata, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "given against the Daevas," or evil
spirits. Obviously this book was regarded as the most
important and valuable part of the law, and to this
circumstance it owes its preservation. Besides this we
have invocations and prayers, chiefly belonging to the
liturgy. They form a considerable collection, known
by the title of Ya&ccedil;na, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> worship. The remainder of
the 348 chapters was lost in the invasion of the Arabs
into Iran, owing to their fanatical zeal for conversion.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Though we were able to establish the fact that these
fragments belonged in their language, their contents,
and their written character to Eastern Iran, and the evidence
of Western writers proved to us that at the time
when Alexander of Macedon overthrew the kingdom
of the Ach&aelig;menids, there were sacred scriptures of considerable
extent in Iran&mdash;this does not enable us to
decide the date of the origin of these scriptures. We
have to inquire whether these writings were known in
the West of Iran also, before the date of the Sassanids;
whether the new collection and revision about the
year 350 of our era was satisfied with faithfully representing
the old condition of the scriptures, so far as it
could be discovered, or whether it altered their contents;
whether the influence exercised by Hellenic and
Aramaic elements in the time of the Seleucids and
Parthians&mdash;so obvious in the one case and so searching
in the other&mdash;affected the contents of the Avesta.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
This question cannot be set aside, because even under
the Sassanids, in spite of their zeal for the Avesta and
for Iran, these elements were not unknown. We are
aware that Greek and Jewish schools flourished in
Syria and Mesopotamia at the date of the Sassanids,
that Chosru Nushirvan (531-578 <small>A.D.</small>) gave his protection
to Damascius and the Platonists in his kingdom,
and caused Greek works to be translated. However
much other virtues, required in the Avesta, were
extolled in this ruler, such as the foundation of fire-temples,
and appointment of sacristans for them, the
promotion of agriculture (no temple was to be without
cultivated lands) and of marriages&mdash;nevertheless sects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
sprung up within the true religion. Even in official
documents of the fifth century we find a certain deviation
from the doctrine of the Avesta; under king
Kavadh (488-453 <small>A.D.</small>), Mazdak, who proclaimed the
community of goods and women, found adherents,
and the Arabs speak of sects in Iran which opposed
the teaching of the Magians.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> They mention the
Zarvanites, the Gayomarthians, and others, of whom
the Zarvanites sought to derive the good and evil
deity from some higher abstraction,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> while the Gayomarthians
represented the evil deity as proceeding from
the thought of the good deity. Had conceptions of
this kind, and other later views which we find in their
doctrines, influence on the restoration of the canon?
The fact that the sacred writings were composed in
a language no longer current, when the canon was
restored, is not a complete safeguard against changes
and interpolations, for the priests at that time may
have understood the language, and therefore may
possibly have been able to compose in it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>ZARATHRUSTRA AND THE DATE OF THE COMPOSITION OF
THE AVESTA.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></h3>


<p>The examination of the difficult questions, whether,
from what period, and to what extent, the Avesta was
known in Western Iran before the time of Alexander,
when the book came into existence, whether its contents
have come down uninjured from an ancient
period, or whether it underwent alterations in the
time of the Parthians and the Sassanids, will be best
opened by collecting and testing the accounts which
have been preserved in the West about Zarathrustra
and his work. Herodotus does not mention him, but
Xanthus the Lydian is said to have spoken of him,
before the date of Herodotus. Plato describes Zoroaster
as the founder of the doctrine of the Magians,
and calls him a son of Oromazes.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> With Hermodorus,
a pupil of Plato, Zoroaster is a Persian, the first
Magian.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Deinon concludes from the name that he
was a worshipper of the stars. Hermippus of Smyrna
speaks of him as a Bactrian, and is said to have
described him as a pupil of Azonakes (or Agonakes).<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
Diodorus informs us that Zoroaster gave out among
the Arians that the good spirit had revealed to him
the laws which he published.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Trogus Pompeius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
relates that Ninus finally carried on war with Zoroaster
the king of the Bactrians, who discovered the
art of the Magians, and inquired accurately into the
primal forces of the world, and the movements of the
stars; he was slain by Ninus.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Pliny observes that
Zoroaster, the founder of the doctrine of the Magians,
smiled on the day of his birth, and beat his head
vigorously as a symbol of his wisdom; for thirty
years he lived in the desert on cheese. Plutarch's
account is that Zoroaster took no other food or drink
all his life but milk, and like Lycurgus and Numa, he
associated with the Divine Being.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Dio Chrysostom
tells us that Zoroaster from his love for wisdom and
justice lived remote from men in solitude on a mountain,
which had been kindled by fire from above, and
burned continuously, and when the king approached
the mountain with his leading men to offer prayer to
the god, Zoroaster came unharmed out of the fire, and
bade them offer sacrifice for the god had visited the
place. After this Zoroaster did not associate with all
men, but only with those who were most adapted to
receive the truth and converse with the god, whom
the Persians called Magians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> those who have skill
to serve the Divine Being.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Kephalion asserted that
Zoroaster the Magian, the king of the Bactrians,
fought with Semiramis and was vanquished by her.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
Theon of Alexandria also speaks of the conflict between
Semiramis and the Bactrian Zoroaster. Arnobius is
aware of the battle of Ninus with Zoroaster and the
Bactrians,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and in Eusebius Zoroaster, the Magian, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>king of the Bactrians, fights against Ninus.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> According
to the treatise of Eubulus of Athens on Mithras,
Porphyrius related that Zoroaster had consecrated a
natural cave, in which were flowers and springs, in
the neighbouring mountains of Persia, in honour of
Mithra, the creator and father of all, and since that
time the favour of the god had been sought in a cave.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
Ammianus Marcellinus calls Zoroaster a Bactrian, and
tells us that Hystaspes, the father of Darius, spread
abroad the doctrine of the Magians.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Agathias remarks
that the Persians of his time asserted that
Zoroaster, or Zaradus, as they called him, who gave
them their religious doctrine and law, the son of
Oromasdes, lived at the time of Hystaspes; but they
made the assertion in such a manner that no man
knew whether this Hystaspes was the father of Darius
or some other of the name. But whatever the date of
his life, he changed the earlier forms of worship, and
was the discoverer of the doctrine of the Magians.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
Suidas distinguishes between the Perso-Mede Zoroaster,
the chief of the Magians, and the astronomer of the
same name, an Assyrian, who lived at the time of
Ninus.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> In Syncellus, Zoroaster is the first of the
eight Median kings, who, according to the statement
of Berosus, reigned over Babylonia from 2458 to
2224 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>These statements do not amount to much. Yet we
find the tradition maintained from the pupils of Plato
down to Agathias, that Zoroaster founded the doctrine
of the Magians; Diodorus, Plutarch, and Dio mention
the intercourse of Zoroaster with the good spirit or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
deity. Diodorus calls him an Arian, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> an inhabitant
of Eastern Iran. Hermippus, Trogus Pompeius,
Kephalion, Theon, Arnobius, and Eusebius speak of him
as a Bactrian, and the king of the Bactrians, and
represent him as fighting with Ninus or Semiramis,
which is also asserted by Moses of Khorene.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Hence
in the last two centuries <small>B.C.</small> it must have been known
in the West that Zoroaster belonged to the East of
Iran, and thus he was brought into connection with the
most prominent fact known in the history of Bactria,
the contest of the Bactrians against Ninus and Semiramis.
This story, as we said, comes from the Medo-Persian
Epos, and moreover the Epos did not authorise
this connection of Ninus and Zoroaster. The opponent
of Ninus, who reigned over Bactria, was, according
to Diodorus, Oxyartes or Exaortes (p. 20). The
fact that Zoroaster was the most important name in
the antiquity of Iran among western nations obviously
induced Syncellus to put him at the head of the
supposed ancient Median dynasty. If Zoroaster, as
Pliny and Plutarch think, lived only on milk and
cheese, and passed thirty years in the wilderness, these
are merely traits taken from the lives of the Brahman
ascetics. The story in Dio Chrysostom, that Zoroaster
came unharmed from the fire, and the opposite statements
of the Chronicle of Alexandria and of Suidas,
that he brought down fire from heaven and was consumed
by it, or struck by lightning, contain traits
which have obviously sprung from the importance
which the doctrine of Zoroaster and the Magians
ascribe to the worship of fire, and from the division
between the fire of lightning and earthly fire, of which
we shall speak below. The narrative of Eubulus is
founded on the mysteries of Mithra, which came into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
the West in the first century <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> These mysteries
are due to the confusion of the Mithra of the Iranians
with the sun-god of the Syrians; the myst&aelig; were
consecrated in caves, or in places called caves, and
there underwent their probation. As the god of
light and the soul Mithra slays in the cave, that is in
the world of gloom and matter, the bull which is the
symbol of matter, as opposed to light, in its creative
power, and conveys the soul, the side of man akin to
light, out of the gloom of matter through the heaven
of the fixed stars, and then through the heaven of
the planets, to the light.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Ammianus Marcellinus
and Agathias have better information about Zoroaster.
They are aware that he stands in some relation to
Hystaspes. Ammianus, though he expressly describes
Zoroaster as a Bactrian, puts Hystaspes the well-known
father of Darius, as the supporter of the doctrine
of the Magians, in the place of the Vista&ccedil;pa of the
Avesta, who opens a wide path for the teaching
of Zoroaster; Agathias, on the other hand, expresses
himself with greater circumspectness; he cannot decide
whether the father of Darius or some other
Hystaspes is meant.</p>

<p>The result is this: Before the time of Alexander
of Macedon, at the latest in the first half of the fourth
century <small>B.C.</small>, the Greeks were aware that Zoroaster
had founded the doctrine of the Magians; in the last
centuries <small>B.C.</small> and onwards it was known that he
belonged to Bactria and Eastern Iran; but it was not
till the fourth century <small>A.D.</small> that he was known to have
lived under king Hystaspes; at any rate we have no
older evidence on this point.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>Much more recent in date, and of far less value,
is the information derived from the East, with the
exception of the Avesta, on Zarathrustra. It does not
go back beyond the period of the Arabian empire over
Iran. The Bundehesh, written in this period (p. 65, <i>n.</i> 3),
contains a genealogy, which carries Zarathrustra's origin
beyond Pourusha&ccedil;pa and Haechata&ccedil;pa, from whom,
according to the Avesta, he was sprung (p. 38), through
twelve generations to Manuschithra (Minocher). In
the Avesta, the soul of the pure Manuschithra, the
son of Airyu, is invoked;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> it has been observed above
that the national genealogy in Iran placed Thraetaona,
and not Manu, at the head; Airyu, the son of Thraetaona,
was the proper progenitor of the Airyas. With the
name Manuschithra, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> scion of Manu, who is now
the son of Airyu, this table passed back into the old
Arian conception of the father Manu (p. 44). In the
Avesta, Zarathrustra is connected by his father, the
fourth sacrificer of the Haoma, with the old sacrificers;
and by deriving his family from Manuschithra the
Bundehesh places him in the closest relation to the
progenitors of the Airyas. For the rest this book has
little to say about the life of Zoroaster. It informs
us that the house of Pourusha&ccedil;pa lay on a hill on the
river Daraja, a river which we cannot identify;<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> the
Bundehesh places it in Airyana Vaeja (Airanvij), in a
district which we must place in the high region of the
Hindu Kush, on the sources of the Oxus (p. 31, <i>n</i>. 2),
though the Bundehesh informs us that "it lay by the
side of Atropatene." According to another passage in
the book, Airyana Vaeja lay near the garden of Yima
and Cashmere. In a third passage the garden of Yima,
which we are compelled by unmistakable indications<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
in the Avesta, to seek on the divine mountain, lies in
the centre of Iran, under Mount Damkan.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Atropatene,
as a name for the Alpine land in the north-west
of Iran (now Aderbeijan), came into use in the
time of the Greek empire; at any rate we cannot trace
it earlier.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> <i>Athrapaiti</i> means "lord of fire"; <i>athrapata</i>,
"one protected by fire"; in the remote mountains of
this district the old fire-worship was preserved with
peculiar zeal under the Seleucids; from the time of
Ardeshir the Sassanids venerated the fire-temple Adar
Gu&ccedil;asp (near Takht-i-Soliman), which lay in this region,
above all others, and this was the reason why in the
time of the Arabs it was thought that Airyana Vaeja
must be sought there.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> In any case it is impossible,
out of regard to the Bundehesh and even later statements
of the Moslem period, to place Zarathrustra in
the north-west of Iran in order to represent him as a
foreigner, reforming the religion of the north-east, when
the Avesta, which distinctly places him in the east
and puts him among the sacrificers and heroes of the
east and rulers of Bactria, together with the older
and more important evidence of the West, is on the
opposite side.</p>

<p>The "Book of Zartusht," one of the most recent
books of the Parsees (it dates from the thirteenth
century of our era), can only tell us of the marvellous
preservation of Zarathrustra and the miracles which
he wrought. The first miracle recorded in it is the
fact that Zoroaster smiled at his birth. But the
wicked king Duransarun sought to murder the newly-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>born
child in his cradle. His arm is paralysed, and
he cannot strike the blow home. Then the evil spirits
steal the child, kindle a great fire in the desert, and
throw him into it. But he sleeps peacefully in the
fire, and his mother recovers him without injury. A
herd of cattle are about to trample him on a narrow
path, when the largest one stands over and protects
him, till the herd have passed by. In a similar manner
he is preserved when a pair of wild horses are driven
over him. Even the wolves will not eat him. When
he has reached his thirtieth year these trials are over,
and Zarathrustra emigrates with his followers. On
reaching Iran the good spirit Vohu mano appeared and
conducted him to Auramazda. He had to pass over a
fiery mountain, but the fire did not singe a hair;
molten metal was poured on his breast, and he felt it
not; his entrails were removed and then replaced
without injury to him. Auramazda gave him the
Avesta and commanded him to go to king Vista&ccedil;pa
(now Kai Gushta&ccedil;p) to Balkh, and proclaim it to him.
In Balkh Zoroaster overcame the sages of the king in
argument, but they maligned him before their master
as a wizard, and he was put in prison. Then the feet
of the king's horse were drawn up into its belly, and
the king bade Zarathrustra heal his horse. He required
the king to believe in him and his doctrine;
and when the king had acknowledged the new faith,
one of the horse's feet was restored to it. Zarathrustra
further demanded that Vista&ccedil;pa's son &Ccedil;pentodata
(Isfendyar) should consecrate himself to the defence of
the new faith, that the king's consort should adopt the
law, and those who maligned him should be punished.
When these three requests had been complied with, the
horse recovered all its four feet. After this Vista&ccedil;pa
did nothing without the advice of Zarathrustra, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
built fire-altars and fire-temples. And Zarathrustra
showed the king the place he would one day occupy in
heaven, and made &Ccedil;pentodata invulnerable.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Hence from the Bundehesh we obtain no more than
the genealogical tree of Zarathrustra, which though
characteristic for the place allotted to him, is without
historical value; and from the Zartusht Nameh,
Sharastani, and Mirkhond, which repeat some miracles
more or less similar to those quoted, we gather nothing
beyond certain traits: the smiling at birth, the fiery
mountain, the preservation of Zarathrustra in the
fire, which Pliny and Dio Chrysostom had already
made known to us, and which belong to the ancient
tradition of Iran. In the miracles which take place by
means of oxen and horses, we can merely recognise
the ancient and close relation of the Arians in Iran
to these animals, a relation which has already been
remarked (p. 46). We might perhaps add that Firdusi
represents Zarathrustra, whom he puts beside
Vista&ccedil;pa, as having been killed at a fire in Balkh when
the city was captured by Turanians. The intercourse
of Zarathrustra with Auramazda was known
to Western writers, as we saw, at a far earlier
date.</p>

<p>If we can hardly glean anything worth notice from
these accounts about Zarathrustra's life and work,
we may perhaps gain some information about his
date. The evidence of Ammianus Marcellinus and Agathias,
when they represent him as a contemporary of
Hystaspes, in whom we recognise Vista&ccedil;pa of Bactria,
carries us no further than the Avesta, which places
him in the closest relation to this prince (p. 38), because
his date is equally uncertain. Trogus Pompeius,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Kephalion, Theon, and Eusebius make Zarathrustra
an opponent and therefore a contemporary of Ninus
and Semiramis. But as neither Semiramis nor Ninus
ruled over Asshur, and they are to be regarded as the
personification of the rise of the power and dominion
of that country (II. 23), we must substitute for this
king and queen the ruler or rulers of Asshur of whom
it is certain that their campaigns reached the east of
Iran. We found that so far as we can at present
judge from the monuments it was only Shalmanesar
II. who received tribute from the Eastern lands, and
that the armies of Tiglath Pilesar II. trod the soil
of Arachosia (p. 19). If we could assume that the
contests of Ninus and Semiramis have taken the place
of the achievements of these rulers in the East of Iran,
the date of Vista&ccedil;pa and Zarathrustra would have
to be placed between 860 and 740 <small>B.C.</small> But this
supposition is really without any basis.</p>

<p>The more ancient statements of the Greeks carry
us much further back than the reasoning of Trogus
Pompeius and his successors. If we set Pliny aside,
who asserts "that the kind of Magism established by
Zoroaster was many years older than that taught by
Moses," Hermippus of Smyrna puts Zoroaster 5000
years before the Trojan war. Even before Hermippus,
Theopompus of Chios, and Hermodorus, the pupil of
Plato, had ascribed the same date to him. Eudoxus
of Cnidus, the contemporary of Plato, placed him still
higher; he thought that Zoroaster lived 6000 years
before the death of Plato. According to Pliny, Aristotle
ascribed to him the same antiquity, and, as we learn
from Diogenes Laertius, maintained that the Magians
were older than the Egyptians. And even in the
fifth century <small>B.C.</small>, Xanthus the Lydian is said to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
written that from the time when Zoroaster lived to
the march of Xerxes against Hellas a period of 6000
years had elapsed.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Through these statements there runs, beyond all
doubt, a system, the knowledge of which began in the
fifth century <small>B.C.</small> among the Greeks and continued
beyond the time of Alexander. Whether we take
5000 years before the Trojan war, or 6000 years before
Plato's death, we are equally brought back into the
seventh millennium <small>B.C.</small> If the later statements of the
West, which make Zoroaster a contemporary of Ninus
and Semiramis, are the results of combining the most
prominent name in Bactria with the conquest of Bactria
by the founder of the Assyrian power, as related
in the Medo-Persian Epos, the fixing of Zoroaster's
date so many thousand years previously must have
been taken by the Greeks from the Persians. In these
dates we seem to be dealing with certain cyclic
periods. We learn from Theopompus of Chios, that
according to the doctrine of the Magians, one of the
two gods Oromazdes and Areimanius would reign and
the other be subject for 3000 years; for another 3000
years they would be in conflict, and one destroy the
works of the other, until at length Areimanius would
succumb and men become happy.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> From this we
may with certainty conclude that periods of 3000
years were in use among the priests of Iran to denote
certain spaces of time, and that these cycles form the
base of the statements of the older Greeks, if we
can prove the use of such periods in the Avesta or
in the books of the Parsees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>In the fragments of the Avesta which have come down
to us we find invocations addressed to the "time without
beginning," "the time that rules the long periods."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
But the fact that Yima's reign is fixed at 1000 years
shows that the priests of Iran reckoned by long
periods, and other expressions in the Avesta (p. 33)
prove that triple multiplications were in use,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> which
agrees with the periods given by Theopompus. If,
therefore, the Greeks of the fifth and fourth century
<small>B.C.</small> relate that Zarathrustra lived about 6000 years
before their time, a system must by that time have
been current among the priests of Iran in which two
cycles of 3000 years were supposed to have elapsed
since the time of the prophet, and the third cycle
had commenced. A book of the Parsees, the Mainyo-i-Khard,
which appears to have been written towards
the close of the empire of the Sassanids,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> tells us that
Angromainyu made a compact with Auramazda for
9000 winters, and when these winters were past,
Angromainyu would be destroyed, and the creation
and all creatures would be as Auramazda had made
them.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The Bundehesh also speaks of a similar compact,
but divides the years in a different manner. All time
consists of 12,000 years. In the first 3000 Auramazda
reigned alone with the creatures which he had created
in an invisible manner; for the first 3000 of the next
9000 everything went according to the will of Auramazda;
for the second 3000 the will of Auramazda
was crossed by that of Angromainyu, but for the last
3000 Angromainyu will be powerless. The Bundehesh
goes into yet further detail in these matters: in the
first 3000 years the heavenly creation was secure from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
attack; in the next 3000 Gayo maretan and the ox,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the first man and the first bull, came into existence.
After these 6000 years the enemy arose and slew the
first man and the first bull. The reign of Yima is
placed by the Bundehesh in the first millennium of the
new period, but this reign extends only to 716 years,
the first 284 years of the thousand being filled with
creatures prior to Yima. The second millennium of
the period is occupied with the reign of Thraetaona,
Manuschithra, Kava Kavata, U&ccedil;a, Hu&ccedil;rava, and
Aurvata&ccedil;pa, and the early part of the reign of Kava
Vista&ccedil;pa, whose thirtieth year coincides with the end
of the second millennium.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> At the beginning of the
third millennium, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a thousand years after the death
of Yima, Zarathrustra appears; and the period of
more successful opposition to the evil spirits begins.
According to the more ancient conception, which may
still be plainly traced in the Avesta, the world began
with the happy age of Yima; it is owing to later views
formed within priestly circles that earlier creatures
such as the first man and first bull are placed before
this period; but it will be shown below that these
views existed when the Avesta was written down. A
later book of the Parsees, the Sad-der-Bundehesh, puts
the period of the conflict between the good and evil
deity at 6000 years, and places Zarathrustra exactly
in the middle of it; he was created 3000 years after
the period of Gayo maretan, and 3000 years before
his own resurrection.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Hence it is clear that the
formation of these cycles rose among the priests of
Iran from the necessity of limiting the period of the
old and new law, and of conflict between the good and
evil spirits, and the desire to fix the date of the more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
successful repulse of evil which came in with Zarathrustra.
The abbreviation of the period of Yima shows
us that the cycles in the Bundehesh do not throughout
agree with those of the Avesta. But it is sufficient to
establish the fact that periods of 3000 years were in
use, and that Zarathrustra appeared at the beginning
of a new millennium, in order to understand that the
Persians could speak to the Greeks of millenniums in
this sense, and of one or two cycles which had elapsed
since Zarathrustra's time.</p>

<p>The idea and tendency of such a scheme for the
history of the world are easily understood: these
periods of 3000 years, which can be increased or diminished
without alteration of the sense, have only a
dogmatic value. We cannot obtain from them any
chronological date for the appearance of Zarathrustra,
nor can we obtain such a date by the attempt to go
back from the chronological statements in recent Parsee
works to the older periods. We may leave unnoticed
the assertion in the book of Arda Viraf that the true
faith had existed in purity for 300 years down to the
time that Alexander came into Iran (p. 50), which would
thus bring Zarathrustra into the seventh century <small>B.C.</small>
The Bundehesh allows 460 years for the reigns of the
Sassanids, 246 for the Askanids, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Arsacids, 16 for
Alexander, before whom come Darai the son of Darai
with 14 years, Darai Chirazatan with 12, Huma (a queen)
with 30, Vohumano with 112, and Vista&ccedil;pa with 90,&mdash;all
subsequent to the appearance of Zarathrustra.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> According
to this, 996 years elapsed between Zarathrustra
and the fall of the Sassanids, and he would thus, if we
reckon from the battle of Nahavend (640 <small>A.D.</small>), be placed
in the year 356 <small>B.C.</small>, in the reign of Artaxerxes Ochus.
But even if we alter the incorrect items in the text of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the Bundehesh in accordance with our better knowledge,
we do not arrive at any result which is even apparently
certain. The dominion of the Sassanids, down to the
date of the battle, did not last 460 but only 414 years;
on the other hand, the Arsacids reigned for 476 years,
not for 264.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The empire of Alexander, if we add
the reigns of the Seleucid&aelig; to his own, occupied 80
years instead of 14, and if in the place of the 26 years
of the two Darais of the Bundehesh, who represent the
kingdom of the ancient Ach&aelig;menids, we put the old
Persian kingdom with 229 years, and add to these
items the numbers given in the Bundehesh for Huma,
Vohumano, and Vista&ccedil;pa, after the appearance of
Zarathrustra, which amount to 232 years, Zarathrustra
would have commenced his work 1431 years before the
battle of Nahavend, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the year 791 <small>B.C.</small> But who
can guarantee that Cyrus, the Persian, overthrew the
empire of the Medes in the year when Huma, the
supposed daughter of Vohumano, died; or that Huma
reigned for 30 years? How could Vohumano, the
grandson of Vista&ccedil;pa, and son of &Ccedil;pentodata (p. 38),
have reigned 112 years, and Vista&ccedil;pa himself 90 years
after the appearance of Zarathrustra? Huma is not
merely a doubtful person, she is altogether fictitious.
She is said to have been the mother of Darai Chirazatan,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Darius I., and to have been called Shamirain,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Semiramis, but her brother was the first Sassan,
the ancestor of the Sassanids. As the later Arabs and
Persians, including Firdousi, are no better informed,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> we
see clearly that the remembrance of the Ach&aelig;menids
had almost entirely died out at the time when these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
writings were composed; only the name of Darius
remained, and an attempt was made to connect this
name with Vista&ccedil;pa by two fictitious names, Vohumano,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the good spirit, and Huma. Besides Vista&ccedil;pa's
son &Ccedil;pentodata (Isfendyar) and Hutao&ccedil;a, the wife
of Vista&ccedil;pa, the Avesta mentions a woman, "the pure
Huma,"<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> out of whom this queen must have been
formed. It is clear that the tradition of the East,
like the Avesta, broke off in the generation after
Vista&ccedil;pa, and that in the Arabian period only the
names Darai and Iskander could be placed between
Vista&ccedil;pa and the Arsacids.</p>

<p>We must attempt to reach the goal by another path.
I have already shown what was the condition of the
sacred scriptures in Iran at the date of Alexander and
the Seleucids (p. 55). Even before Hermippus of
Smyrna, Aristotle had taught that the Magians considered
that to be the best in the first instance
which was first created, and maintained two principles,
a good and evil deity, Oromazdes and Areimanius.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
Theopompus mentioned both these deities
and the strife between them, and when he adds
that there would one day be a time when the dead
would rise again, and men would be immortal and able
to withstand everything by their prayers&mdash;that after the
victory of Oromazdes men would be happy and need
no longer any sustenance, and would cast no shadow<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>&mdash;it
will be seen below how definitely and exactly the
doctrine of the Avesta is here reproduced. Hermodorus
mentions a series of teachers, who succeeded the first
teacher of the Magians, the "Persian Zoroaster," down
to the campaign of Alexander of Macedon.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> With
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>Eudoxus of Cnidus Zoroaster was the founder of the
most beneficent wisdom; the pupils of Prodicus claimed
to be acquainted with the writings of Zoroaster (p. 53).
Plato calls him the son of Oromazdes, and adds that
the heir to the throne was instructed in Magism as
well as in the duty of being true during the whole of
his life.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The importance which the Avesta ascribes
to truthfulness will become clear hereafter. If the
Greeks of the fourth century could speak of Zoroaster
as the teacher of the Persians, and put him in the
closest relation with Auramazda, if they could reproduce
correctly the names of the good and evil spirits
and the main doctrines of the Avesta, it is an inevitable
conclusion that the religion of Zarathrustra must
have prevailed in the kingdom of the Ach&aelig;menids.</p>

<p>This result is confirmed by all the further information
which we obtain from the Greeks. In Plutarch
the last Darius calls on an eunuch, "to tell the truth in
reverence for the great light of Mithra"; the eunuch
replies that the king has no reason to accuse the evil
spirit, and entreats "Lord Oromazdes," "that he may
cause the light of the king to shine again."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Artaxerxes
II. was informed by his mother Parysatis that the
Persians had received the law which distinguished
good and evil from god. He swears "by Mithra,"
and Plutarch tells us how some related that when
Darius, the eldest son of Artaxerxes, who sought his
life, was slain, Artaxerxes went into the court of the
palace and cried aloud to the Persians: "Rejoice, ye
Persians, and tell it to others, that the great Oromazdes
has executed judgment on those who imagined
crime and wickedness."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> In Plutarch, Artaxerxes I.
says to Themistocles: "May Areimanius ever implant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
such a disposition in my enemies that they may drive
from themselves their best and bravest men."<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> According
to Deinon the Magians prophesied with branches in
their hands, sacrificed under the open sky, and looked
on fire and water as the only symbols of the divinity.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
Xenophon represents Cyrus as praising the gods and
sacrificing to them every morning according to the
instructions of the Magians.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Though Herodotus does
not mention either the name of Zarathrustra or of
Auramazda, what he says of the rites of the Medes
and Persians agrees exactly with the rules given in the
Avesta. "Temples, images, and altars," he says, "are
not erected by the Persians, because, as it seems to me,
they do not believe like the Hellenes that the gods
have the form and nature of men. They call the
whole circle of heaven Zeus, and offer sacrifice to
him after ascending the summits of mountains. Besides
Zeus they have from ancient days sacrificed to
the sun, the moon, the earth, water, winds, and fire,
which among the Persians is a deity:<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> the winds they
also charm by songs. When offering sacrifice they
build no altar and kindle no fire, nor pour libations, nor
make any use of flutes, or cakes, or barley meal. If
any one wishes to offer sacrifice he brings the victim
to an open space, and calls on the god, after crowning
his tiara with branches of myrtle. After cutting the
animal in pieces, and cooking the flesh, he spreads out
the most delicate grass, chiefly trefoil, and lays the
flesh upon it. The Magian who stands by sings the
theogony over it, for such, according to the Persians, is
the nature of the prayer. After some time, the person
who has made the sacrifice carries the flesh away and
uses it for a feast. The Magians, in whose control is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the worship by sacrifice, make it a great object to kill
ants, serpents, and other creeping winged things: dogs
and men only do they spare. No Persian may pollute
a river, nor even wash in it, nor will they allow any
one else to do so, for they have a great reverence for
rivers. The bodies of the dead may not be burned; it
is said indeed that the corpse of a Persian cannot be
buried till it has been torn by a dog or a bird, and
among the Magians this is an acknowledged practice.
It is a meritorious act among the Persians to have many
children, and he who can show the most receives gifts
each year from the king. Each man celebrates the day
on which he was born above all other days. What may
not be done, may not be spoken of amongst the Persians:
the most shameful action is lying, and the next to this is
borrowing, for the reason that a man who has debts is
generally compelled to lie. Any one afflicted by the
itch or the leprosy may not come into the cities or mix
with other Persians; and it is believed that such persons
have sinned against the sun-god. Lepers from foreign
lands are driven out of the country." When Xerxes came
to the Hellespont, and was about to cross the bridge,
Herodotus represents him as praying to the sun-god,
pouring libations from a golden cup, and throwing it
with a golden goblet and a Persian sword into the sea.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
We shall see hereafter to what a degree the killing of
noxious animals, the reverence for rivers, the expulsion
of lepers, the delight in life and the increase of life,
the exposing of dead bodies, and singing of the
theogony at sacrifices, correspond to the rules and
doctrines of the Avesta. In one point only is Herodotus
mistaken: he states that the Persians worshipped
a female deity called Mithra.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>From this array of witnesses belonging to the West
it follows that the doctrines of the Avesta, and the
religion of Zarathrustra, were current among the Persians
and in Western Iran at any rate after the beginning
of the fifth century <small>B.C.</small>, and they must therefore have
been in existence in Eastern Iran at a still earlier date.
The inscriptions of the Ach&aelig;menids prove that the doctrine
of the Avesta was maintained among the Persians
with even greater clearness and for a period more
ancient. Artaxerxes Ochus prays to Auramazda, Anahita,
and Mithra for their protection, and in like
manner Artaxerxes Mnemon prays to Auramazda and
Mithra. In the inscriptions on Mount Behistun,
Darius I., the son of Hystaspes, styles Auramazda
"the greatest of the gods" (<i>mathista baganam</i>). Besides
Auramazda, "the rest of the gods" are repeatedly
mentioned, and denoted by the name Baga. Of Auramazda,
Darius and Xerxes say in their inscriptions:
"A great god is Auramazda; he has created the
heaven and the earth; he has created man and all that
is good for men." After crushing in the beginning
of his reign the rebellion of nearly all the lands which
Cyrus had reduced, Darius repeatedly records his
thanks: "that Auramazda had granted him assistance;
that his army had been victorious by the grace of
Auramazda." He and his successors acknowledge that
they have received their throne and their kingdom
from Auramazda; by his grace they are kings.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> The
reason why Auramazda has assisted him Darius finds
in the fact that he has not been a "liar," and has
committed no sin. He entreats Auramazda to protect
the land against the invasion of hostile armies, against
blight, and "the lie" (<i>drauga</i>). He asserts that "the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
lie" caused the provinces which had revolted to be
rebellious, and declares that the land of Persia, which
Auramazda has granted to him, which is beautiful, rich
in horses, and well populated, has no fear of enemies
owing to Auramazda's grace, and his own. He commends
his inscription at Behistun to the protection of
his successors, with the words: "If thou destroyest not
this tablet then may Auramazda be thy friend; may
thy descendants be numerous, and thy life be long,
and whatsoever thou undertakest, may Auramazda
cause it to succeed. But if thou destroyest it, may
Auramazda smite thee, and thy house perish; and
whatever thou doest, may Auramazda render it of no
effect."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> On his tomb Darius says: "What I have
done I have done by the grace of Auramazda. O man,
this is the prayer of Auramazda; think no evil, leave
not the right way, sin not." The inscriptions of
Xerxes regularly end with the invocation: "May
Auramazda protect me, with all the gods; me, my
kingdom, and my work."</p>

<p>As we shall see, the fundamental principle of the
religion of Zarathrustra is that a supreme god stands
over all gods, and to him is ascribed the work of
creation. In entire belief in the power of this
supreme deity, whom the Ach&aelig;menids invoke by the
name which is given to him in the Avesta, "who has
created heaven and earth and all that is good for
men," Darius ascribes to Auramazda victory in battles,
the power of granting or refusing success to the king's
undertakings, of protecting the land against hostile invasions,
blight, and lies. To those who live according
to his commands he grants long life and numerous
descendants. The rebellion of the provinces is with
Darius the work of the lie, the lie of him who had given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
himself out to be the son of Cyrus, and the lie of those
who had claimed to be the descendants of Nebuchadnezzar
and Cyaxares. We have already observed what
"the lie" meant in the Avesta. In the same spirit&mdash;the
spirit of the principal rules of the Avesta&mdash;Darius
adjures his Persians to think no evil, and not to leave
the right path.</p>

<p>Nicolaus of Damascus assures us that the Persians
were acquainted with the sayings of Zoroaster. He
and others relate that Cyrus or his father was called
Atradates, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> given by fire,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and that he had given
to the Areians (p. 11), who provided his famished
army with sustenance, the honourable title of Orosangians,
i.&nbsp;e. <i>Huverez&agrave;nha</i> (benefactors). It is in
harmony with the doctrine of the Avesta that Cyrus
should be represented by such a descent or name as the
gift and nursling of fire, and we shall see with what
emphasis the Avesta marks and distinguishes good
thoughts, words, and actions. From these facts and
the inscriptions of Darius there can be no doubt that
Zarathrustra's doctrine was current among the Persians
at the time of Cyrus. But if it was in force in the
West of Iran in the sixth century <small>B.C.</small> the fact that
Herodotus, in his account of the period during which
the Medes obtained the dominion, down to the time of
Cyrus, speaks of no change in religion, either among
the Persians or the Medes, is evidence that this religion
existed at any rate before the time of Phraortes.
The statement found in Herodotus that Deioces had
forbidden any one to spit in his presence, reminds
us of the rules of the Avesta, by which no one was
allowed to approach the sacred fire and gods with
uncovered mouth, and on the sculptures of Persepolis
the bearer of the fan stands with covered mouth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
beside Darius. The seven walls which Herodotus
represents Deioces as building round Ecbatana, the
seven tribes of the Persians, remind us of the seven
girdles of the earth in the Avesta; the king of the
Persians surrounded by the six tribal princes is the
symbol of Auramazda and the six gods who are about
him.</p>

<p>Hence we may assume that the doctrine of Zarathrustra
had reached the West of Iran at the time
when Phraortes united the tribes of the Medes (about
650 <small>B.C.</small>), and was known among the Medes when
they were still living under their tribal chiefs and
paid tribute to Asshur, or, in case of refusal, were attacked
by the Assyrian armies, which, as we ascertained
from the inscriptions of the kings of Asshur, was the
case from the time of Tiglath Pilesar II. to the time of
Assurbanipal, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> from the middle of the eighth to the
middle of the seventh century <small>B.C.</small> A statement in
Herodotus seems to lead us still further back. He
calls the Magians a race or tribe of the Medes. According
to his narrative this tribe was in existence
in the time of Deioces, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> about the year 700 <small>B.C.</small>
Herodotus could only speak of the Magians as a tribe
or family when they had become an hereditary order.
At that time, therefore, there must have been among
the Medes a priesthood who perpetuated in their
families their worship by sacrifice, their doctrine and
wisdom, as well as their social importance. Like
all Greeks, Herodotus ascribes the discharge of the
religious functions among the Persians and Medes to
the Magians, and we find that what Herodotus quotes
of their rites agrees with the rules of the Avesta.
The rise and separation of a peculiar order of priests,
their more or less sharply marked distinction from the
remaining orders, can never be the work of a short<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
space of time, and such separation can only take place
when the worship of the gods requires a knowledge
which is not easily accessible or obtainable, when
doctrine has obtained a place by the side of belief,
when ritual has become developed, and particular
duties and rules are prescribed for the life of the
priests. When the worship of the gods requires the
use of long and definite prayers, the knowledge of
complicated usages, on which depends the effect of
the sacrifices, and the observation of numerous rules of
purification,&mdash;such knowledge is only perpetuated in
families of hierophants or priests, or in schools which
take the place of such families. The formation of a
distinct hereditary order on such grounds can hardly
have occupied less than a century from the time when
the doctrine, on which it is formed, was introduced.
Hence we may assume that the doctrine known as
Zarathrustra's reached the Medes before the year
750 <small>B.C.</small>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> before the date of Tiglath Pilesar II. of
Assyria.</p>

<p>Let us hold firmly to the facts that the worship of
Auramazda was current among the Persians about the
middle of the sixth century <small>B.C.</small>, that the same worship
was in force among the Medes at least a century
earlier, about 650 <small>B.C.</small>, and that if an hereditary priesthood
was in existence about this time among the Medes
who performed and conducted the worship, the doctrine
which this priesthood represented must have been
adopted before the year 750 <small>B.C.</small> In this way we
obtain a proof that the doctrine of Zarathrustra was
not only in existence in the East of Iran about the
year 800 <small>B.C.</small>, but was the dominant creed there, and
had force enough to penetrate to the West, and win over
the neighbouring tribes of the Medes and Persians.</p>

<p>We cannot explain more exactly how the doctrine of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Zarathrustra reached the nations of the West of Iran.
Pliny, it is true, exclaims: "Who knows the Medes,
who were taught by Zoroaster, Apusorus, and Zaratus,
even by hearsay, for no memorials of them are left?"<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
According to this the religion of Zoroaster spread
even in the West by the influence of eminent men
among the Medes. But the date of the persons mentioned
cannot be fixed, though Porphyry represents
Pythagoras as going to the Chald&aelig;ans and Zabratus,
by whom he was purified from the evil of his former
life, and instructed as to the things from which the
disciple should restrain himself, and about the nature
and beginning of all things,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and this Zaratus or
Zabratus may be intended for Zarathrustra himself.
Hermodorus tells us that Zarathrustra had been followed
by many Magians as teachers, one after the
other, down to the time when Alexander marched
against Persia: these teachers were Osthanes, Astrampsychus,
Gobryas, and Pazates.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Others also assert
that Zoroaster was followed "by Osthanes and Astrampsychus."<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
Pliny observes that so far as he could
discover, Osthanes who accompanied Xerxes in the
war against the Hellenes, was the first who had written
on the doctrine of the Magians. The second Osthanes,
whom Alexander had received among his followers,
had caused this religion to be of great importance.
From the work of one of these two persons, Philo of
Byblus quotes a passage&mdash;the work he calls the
Octateuch&mdash;and Pliny notes down apparently some of
the doctrines of the first Osthanes. If then there were
men under the Ach&aelig;menids in the West of Iran who
could write on the doctrine of Zarathrustra from the
beginning of the fifth century <small>B.C.</small>, we can without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
hesitation believe the statement that long before this
time there were prophets and teachers of the doctrine
among the Medes and the Persians.</p>

<p>Can we go beyond the result thus gained by our
investigation?&mdash;that the doctrine of Zoroaster flourished
in Eastern Iran about 800 <small>B.C.</small>, and advanced towards
the West from this period; may we assume that at this
date it was already in possession of written monuments,
and even that the fragments of the Avesta which still
remain were in existence then? We must first answer
the question whether the use of writing in Iran,
especially in the East, goes back so far.</p>

<p>According to the statements of Herodotus, the West
of Iran was not only in possession of the art of writing
by the year 700 <small>B.C.</small>, but made considerable use of it.
He tells us that Deioces required complaints to be
sent in to him in writing, and gave out his decisions
also in writing. If processes at law were conducted in
writing in Media about the year 700 <small>B.C.</small>, it cannot be
surprising that Herodotus should also inform us that
letters passed between Media and Persia about the
year 560 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> We learn from the Hebrew Scriptures
that when Cyrus allowed the Jews, whom Nebuchadnezzar
had removed to Babylon, to return to their
homes, he gave his permission for the restoration of
the temple in writing. This document was afterwards
discovered in the archives of Ecbatana.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> We know it
for a fact that Darius I. gave his orders to the satraps
in writing, and we are acquainted with the seal of
Darius by which they were authenticated. The oldest
inscriptions which have come down to us from the
Ach&aelig;menids, not to mention a seal of Cyrus from
Senkereh, belong, if not to Cyrus himself, to Darius,
and begin about the last quarter of the sixth century<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
<small>B.C.</small> It is the cuneiform writing of Assyria and
Babylon which forms the basis of the writing in these
inscriptions, but with considerable alterations. The
highly complicated syllabarium of the Eastern Semites
is reduced to a phonetic system; we might almost say
to an alphabet of about 40 letters. A change of this
kind can hardly have been made at one stroke. If it
was after they entered into closer combination with
Assyria, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> after their dependence on the king of
Asshur, which began with the accession of Tiglath
Pilesar II. (745 <small>B.C.</small>), that the Medes became acquainted
with the Assyrian system of writing, this must have
been completely mastered before it could be abbreviated
and altered, as it was altered by the Medes,
whose changes were adopted by the Persians. The
cuneiform writing of Western Iran, as we find it in the
inscriptions of Darius, can therefore hardly have been
established before the year 600 <small>B.C.</small> However this may
be, the facts mentioned prove that the writing of the
Assyrians in the seventh century <small>B.C.</small> was not unknown
in the West of Iran. This would therefore have
passed into the East of Iran in its original or simplified
form, either at some earlier period, or when the East
came under the dominion of the Ach&aelig;menids. But it
did not, and this is a plain proof that the East, when
the cuneiform writing of the West came in that
direction, was already in possession of another kind
of writing. This Eastern mode of writing, the Arian,
which rests on an entirely different basis from the
cuneiform, is first known to us from coins and inscriptions
of the third century <small>B.C.</small>; but it certainly would
not have maintained its ground under the Ach&aelig;menids
against the writing of the West, and of the rulers,
magistrates, and dominant nation, unless it had been
in vigorous use before, this period. We must therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
assume that the Arian character was in use in the East
of Iran a considerable time before the date of Cyrus,
and hence we have no reason to deny the existence of
it in that region in the eighth century <small>B.C.</small>, since we
must allow the neighbouring Arians of India to have
been in possession of their written characters from the
year 800 <small>B.C.</small> at the least (IV. 155).</p>

<p>If we may assume that the Arian character was in
use in the East of Iran about the year 800 <small>B.C.</small>, the
prayers and sayings of Zarathrustra might have been
written down about this date, and the doctrine might
have passed on to the West supported by written
documents. But the fact that the prayers might have
been written down is in no way a proof that they were
so written.</p>

<p>It is true that at first sight it seems that the part of
the law which has come down to us (the Vendidad)
leads to the conclusion that it was written down long
before the Persians gained the dominion over Iran,
and Media became a powerful state under Cyaxares.
The book does not mention the name of the Persians
or the Medes, of Ecbatana or Persepolis, while Bactria
is spoken of as the seat of the empire; the most
westerly district mentioned in the Vendidad is Ragha
in Eastern Media.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> If we add that the book reproaches
certain districts in the East, the land of the
Arachoti and others, with deviations from the doctrine
of Zarathrustra, and that Ragha is indeed Zoroastrian
but wavering in its fidelity, we may easily conclude
that the Vendidad was written when the doctrine of
Zarathrustra had not as yet thoroughly penetrated the
East, and was still unknown in the West, when it had
just reached, but had not yet completely conquered, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
district of Ragha. The Medes were still dependent on
Asshur, living separately according to their tribes, Ecbatana
was not yet the centre and metropolis of Media, and
the kingdom of Bactra was still in existence in the East.
This points to a date about 750 <small>B.C.</small> as the time when
this doctrine must have spread widely over Media; at
any rate to a date before the rise of the Median power,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> before 650 <small>B.C.</small> This conclusion is not, however,
absolutely certain. The silence of the Vendidad and
of the Avesta generally on Ecbatana and Persepolis,
the Medes and the Persians, can be explained in
another though a more artificial manner. The nations
and chief cities of the West were unknown to the
tradition of Eastern Iran, and the royal abodes of the
Medes and Persians were not consecrated by the action
of Zarathrustra. In the accounts given by the Greeks
of the worship of these nations, in spite of much
agreement, points are found at variance with the rules
of the Avesta, and as a fact certain distinctions did
prevail. The doctrine had arisen in the East, and the
priesthood there was in possession of the purer and
more orthodox dogma. If Persia and Media did not
follow this in all respects, it was convenient to be
silent about the differences in the time of the Ach&aelig;menids,
or if any one desired to brand them, to mark out
the Median Ragha as the seat of heresy, rather than
Pasargad&aelig; or Persepolis. This explanation it is true
is somewhat far fetched. The result that the religion
known by the name of Zarathrustra had reached the
Medes and Persians by the middle of the eighth
century <small>B.C.</small> is in no way weakened by it, though the
assumption that at this period written documents of
this doctrine were in existence, and that the book
of the law of which we have fragments arose in
the first half of the eighth century <small>B.C.</small>, is rendered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
more doubtful if such a mode of interpretation is
admitted.</p>

<p>The forms of language preserved in the Avesta
have not survived with sufficient distinctness to
assist us in fixing the time at which it was written
down. As was shown above (p. 65), the manuscripts
date from the later period of the Sassanids;
they are written in the later East-Pehlevi character,
and at a time when the old forms must have undergone
changes owing to the language which had come
into use in the mean time, and can in fact be proved to
have undergone them. The old sounds are obviously
modified and confounded,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> so that the language of the
Avesta, when compared with that of the inscriptions of
the Ach&aelig;menids, exhibits forms less ancient and fixed,
and indeed in some cases it is more recent than the
language of the legends of the Gr&aelig;co-Bactrian coins
(p. 27). Nor can any certain conclusions be drawn
from the condition of political and social life shown in
the Avesta. It is only the splendour of regal power
in general, the old sacrificers, heroes, and kings that are
extolled in it; a sacrificial prayer to Mithra speaks of
the abode of the Arians, where "horse-guiding rulers
govern noble troops;" for the rest we hear only of
lords of villages, of tribes or cantons, and provinces, and
of three orders into which the people are divided.
The Vendidad, it is true, reckons by winters and
nights, not by years and days; the amount of fines
and punishments is computed in animals, goats, sheep,
oxen, horses, or camels; and these facts point to an
ancient period, but they may have been handed down by
tradition. We also hear of the value of these animals
and of money (<i>shaeta</i>).<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> This is the less surprising as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the Vendidad speaks of palaces and pillars and various
works of art, and mentions smelting-ovens and even
ovens for making glass. We found that the Greek
princes of Bactria struck square coins, which they
would not have done if this had not been the traditional
form in Bactria (p. 28). The Ach&aelig;menids did not
strike coins of this kind, and this shape must therefore
have come down from a period anterior to them. The
frequent mention of the physician, on the other hand,
ought not to be regarded as a proof of later composition,
for we hear of the physician and his remedies in
ancient poems of the Veda (IV. 35).</p>

<p>In regard to the antiquity of the Avesta, then, we
can only build upon the simple facts that it cannot
have been written down for the first time when the
Buddhists found adherents in Bactria (IV. 542), or
when the kingdom of the Greek princes arose in
Bactria, or when the Seleucid&aelig; and Alexander, before
them, reigned over Iran. It has been proved that the
Avesta was in existence before Alexander overthrew
the kingdom of the Ach&aelig;menids. The series of the
successors of Zarathrustra, which western writers could
trace backwards from this point&mdash;Osthanes II., Pazates,
Gobryas, Osthanes I., Astrampsychus, Apusodorus&mdash;plainly
shows that even under the Ach&aelig;menids the
West was seriously occupied with religious questions.
As Osthanes I. had written on the doctrine of Zoroaster
about the time of Xerxes (p. 92), it is at
least more probable than not that the Avesta was
already in existence at that time. If in the West
there was a series, and as the Greeks point out, a
continuous series, of priestly teachers, round whom
naturally pupils and schools grew up, and after the
beginning of the fifth century a theological literature,
similar teachers and schools must have existed long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
before in the East, and this greatly strengthens the conclusion
drawn from the contents of the Vendidad, that
it must have been written down before the rise of the
Medes. But for any more precise determination of the
date of the Avesta between the two limits obtained&mdash;the
year 750 <small>B.C.</small>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the beginning of the formation of a
priesthood in the West and the contemporary use of
writing in the East, and the year 350 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;we are
confined wholly to internal evidence.</p>

<p>Scriptures of such extent as the Avesta is shown to
have been, by the accounts of the Greeks and Arabs,
and the list of contents (p. 51), and the existing
fragments, could not have been written down at once
or within a brief space of time. We saw (p. 33)
that it set up a religious canon, which not only regulated
the doctrine and the worship, the duties of priests
and laity, but also comprised the law, and in a word all
the relations of life. A codification of this kind is
only possible when belief and doctrine, culture and
ritual, have arrived at fixed and complete formul&aelig;,
have been arranged in a system and developed, and
the consequences bearing on life, morality, and law
have been drawn from them by an active and influential
priesthood. Hence before the Avesta was written
down and collected there must have been a priestly
order in the East, in the circles of which the doctrine
and practice went through this developing, revising,
and fixing process. Various sketches, lists of prayers
for certain offerings, collections of rules belonging to
this or that priesthood or school, must have been in
existence, and combinations of the traditional material
must have been made, before a canon comprising the
whole wisdom of the priests, and far exceeding in
extent the law of Manu, could have been compiled.</p>

<p>Among the existing invocations of the Avesta we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
find sacrificial prayers of a primitive character; but
the greater part of the prayers and thanksgivings are
without religious feeling or poetical power, and very
far removed from the richness and abundance, the
beauty and freshness of conception, which streams
through the majority of the hymns of the Veda.
There are not wanting <i>na&iuml;ve</i> and poetical pieces which
have obviously been handed down and preserved by
their use at sacrifices, but these are frequently spoiled
by later interpolations, and the form of the whole is
generally dry and prosaic. We find but scanty relics
of any vigorous conception of the gods, of a living
mythology; on the whole the mythical element is faded,
and the sacrifice of animals thrown into the background.
The greater part of the prayers receive their value
from a certain system and completeness; the object is
to bring forward all the characteristics of the deity to
which they are addressed, and to invoke him by all
his names. Thus laudations and epithets are repeated
without end. A good many of the prayers are mere
nomenclatures, and repeat the same forms in varying
order. Besides this tendency, which is far removed
from the original simplicity of religious meditation, a
value is ascribed to the repetition of certain prayers.
Some are to be said a hundred, or a thousand times.
In the same way the liturgies are long and full of
detail, and sometimes take the form of responses
between the celebrant and the ministering priest;
they are extremely careful to neglect none of the
heavenly spirits or genii, or to injure them by omission,
or treat them with less respect than others.</p>

<p>Beside the faded colours of the mythology, the
decreasing importance of animal sacrifice, and the
formalism of the prayers, we observe in the five
Gathas, the invocations which alone have preserved the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
verse-measure, and present older forms of language
than the rest, a tendency to speculation. Not only
are the good and evil spirits combined under one head,
as is always the case in the Avesta, but the Gathas
attempt to resolve the contrast of the beneficial and
harmful sides of nature, of the good and evil spirits,
into the reciprocal play of two fundamental forces;
they identify the prosperity and destruction of nature
with moral good and evil, and combine the one with
truth, the other with falsehood. The good spirits are
the truth, the evil are the lie. The life of appearance
and of falsehood is distinguished from the true life,
and the service of truth promises life not in this world
only but in the next. It is in harmony with these
tendencies to abstraction that, according to other passages
of the Avesta, heaven is filled with a multitude
of the most lifeless personifications of ideas and realities.
Could the doctrine of a new religion in an
early period come forward with such a spiritualised
system, with such elevated moral demands, such abstract
conceptions? Could prayers of such a kind
have been composed or written down in a primitive
age?</p>

<p>The existing fragment of the book of the law is
composed in the form of a dialogue, and is for the
most part filled with conversations which Zarathrustra
carries on with Auramazda. Zarathrustra inquires
what is to be done in certain cases against the evil
spirits, the Daevas, on the commission of certain sins
and impurities. What must be done when a woman is
in labour, etc., or when any one has made himself impure
by touching a corpse, or has slain a water-dog (otter)?
Is the rain impure which has fallen on a corpse and
then runs off from it, etc.? These questions Auramazda
answers very precisely, and when it is a matter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
for expiation and purification, he fixes the number of
stripes with the horse-whip or the whip of the sacred
&Ccedil;raosha (&Ccedil;raosha-charana) which the penitent is to receive.
It is a theory and practice of purity, on a level
with the analogous rules in the laws of Manu, and in
some points even more subtle and casuistical. The
offences have already been brought under definite categories,
and in like manner the purifications and punishments
fall into a number of distinct classes. Not only
are expiations required for all sins and prescribed down
to the minutest details, but the offences must also
be repented of; certain formul&aelig; of confession and
repentance are prescribed.</p>

<p>We need not stop to prove that a book of laws
in this form could not have been written down <i>&agrave; priori</i>.
The rules for punishment and purification must have
grown up in long practice, before they could be put
in the mouth of the deity; difficulties and doubts
must have been weighed before solutions could be
proposed. The book contains the dialogues and inquiries
which were held in the schools of the priests on
questions of this kind, the practice which prevailed
in the schools and the catechisation of the pupils.
The answer is naturally placed in the mouth of Auramazda,
for it was the answer which he once gave to
the question when asked by Zarathrustra. The fragments
of the Vendidad are a catechism, the result
of the labour of the priestly schools, a system of rules
and regulations which marks and postulates the same
stage of development for Iran as was reached for the
Indians on the Ganges by the law of Manu. Many
periods in the religious life must have been passed
through before the religious consciousness was no longer
shocked by the fact that the supreme deity in person
answered petty questions of ritual, and dictated in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the most exact gradation and with regard to every
possible variety of circumstance, the number of stripes
required for the criminals.</p>

<p>This faded mythology and formalised worship, these
speculative attempts and casuistry of law, are accompanied
by a completely-arranged scheme of certain
abstract categories already established. Throughout the
whole Avesta runs the division between this world
and the next, between the corporeal and incorporeal
world, truth and falsehood, and the triple distinction of
thinking, speaking, and acting, of thought, word, and
deed. And when we further consider that rewards are
attached to the reading of sections of the Avesta, that
the "long study" of the "thoughts of the pure man,"
"the excellent knowledge, thought, and conception"
are praised and invoked as divine powers, no one will
be inclined to see in the Avesta the product of <i>na&iuml;ve</i>
religious feeling, or the deposit of a priestly civilisation
which is as yet in its early stages.</p>

<p>Still, if we wish to avoid making any false steps in
the conclusions to be drawn from the nature of the
Avesta about the time of its composition, we must
bear in mind that it contains some conceptions which
are the exact opposite of the characteristics just
noticed. The myth of Yima, the form of Mithra,
the descent of plants, prove older traits in the Avesta
than we find in the Veda; the old gods still occupy
a large space beside Auramazda and the abstract
forms of heaven, and strict unity of system is not yet
attained. We must remember also at what an early
date the neighbours of Eastern Iran, the Arians of India,
arrived at meditation and abstraction; how quickly and
entirely they allowed animal sacrifice to pass into the
background; with what breadth and detail they
developed the rules for purification; how numerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
were the daily prayers and repetitions, before the
religious feeling became weakened. In the Avesta the
time without limit is frequently invoked; among the
Indians the gods of light are even in the oldest hymns
of the Veda the sons of Aditi, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the Eternal or
the Infinite. And if the attitude of the Avesta is for the
most part by far more flat and prosaic than that of the
Veda, the Arians of Iran were of a more logical nature,
and the glow of imagination which the land of the
Ganges kindled in their kindred tribes did not exist in
Iran. For this reason the consideration of the character
of the Avesta can only lead us to the result that
a period of several centuries must have elapsed between
the rise of the religion named after Zarathrustra and
the writing down of the Avesta; that lists of prayers
and rubrics must have been in existence about the year
800 <small>B.C.</small>; that the extensive books which then formed
the Avesta may have been written in the first half of
the period, which we ascribed to them, extending from
750 to 350 <small>B.C.</small> In any case we can maintain that
the Gathas were composed, and that the Avesta existed
in its essential parts in the East of Iran, before Cyrus
put the empire of the Persians in the place of the
empire of the Medes, and all the various parts were
collected together before the "Enlightened" began to
preach on the Ganges, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> about the year 600 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>We have already remarked the importance which
the Ach&aelig;menids ascribed to the possession of Bactria
(p. 23); and we were able at any rate to guess at the
civilisation of that district about the year 500 <small>B.C.</small>, from
the amount of the tribute imposed upon it by Darius.
That the economic civilisation was not behind the
material was shown by indications in the Avesta. The
kingdom which grew up there, as we saw (p. 47),
long before the days of the Medes, and in which about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the year 800 <small>B.C.</small> the doctrine of Zarathrustra was
current, succumbed to Cyrus, the great founder of the
Persian empire. If we place the beginning of the doctrine
of Zarathrustra, which first made its appearance
there, before the middle of the ninth century <small>B.C.</small>, at
which time the armies of Shalmanesar II. reached the
East of Iran, and assume that it came forward about
1000 <small>B.C.</small>, we shall hardly place its rise too high. We
remember that about this time occurred the great
change in the religious conceptions of the Arians in
India, the repression and degradation of the old gods
by Brahman. It was an analogous development when
the good and evil spirits of Bactria were combined into
unities, and placed under leaders, when the chief of
the deities of light was made the creator of the heaven
and the earth, and surrounded with abstract forms,
which contest the traditional place and honour of the
old god. It is the same religious impulse, the desire
to grasp the unity of the divine nature, the same line
of combination that we observed in its beginning and
progress in India, which comes to the surface in the
doctrine of Zarathrustra. We have no reason to contest
with the Avesta the fact that Vista&ccedil;pa ruled over
Bactria when this change took place, or that Zarathrustra,
a man of the race of Haechata&ccedil;pa, gave the
impulse to the reform, and that the leading idea in it
belongs to him. If Vista&ccedil;pa ruled over Bactria about
the year 1000 <small>B.C.</small> the growth of the Bactrian monarchy
must be placed at least a century before this time, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
about the year 1100 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE GODS OF THE ARIANS IN IRAN.</h3>


<p>The examination of the traditions of the East and
West has simply led to the confirmation of the result,
which we gain from the Avesta&mdash;that the name and
the doctrine of Zarathrustra belong to Bactria. With
regard to the antiquity of the doctrine, the inscriptions
of Darius and the statements of the Greeks
allowed us to draw the conclusion that it became current
and dominant in Bactria about the year 800 <small>B.C.</small>;
and from the analogy of the development of the Arians
on both sides of the Ganges we assumed that it was
possible to place the date of Zarathrustra himself about
two centuries earlier. That the Arians of Iran were
not without gods and religious worship before Zarathrustra,
if the fact needed proof, might be shown
from the statements in the Avesta regarding the time
previous to Zarathrustra. The examination of the
legends of this time established kindred forms and
traits in the Avesta and the Veda, and if, following
this path further, we find in the Avesta views of the
nature and character of the gods corresponding to
those of the Veda, we might be confident in regarding
them as the traditional possession of the Arians, and
their earliest forms of religion. If, in fine, the coincidence
of the Avesta with the Veda, on the one hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
and with the accounts of the Greeks on the other,
extended to all the essential points in the doctrine and
the law, the question stated above&mdash;whether in the
restoration of the canon of the sacred writings in the
midst of the fourth century of our era, under king
Shapur II., the Avesta underwent material alterations,
would have to be answered in the negative.</p>

<p>The poems of the Veda showed us in what directions
the religious feeling of the Indians in the Panjab
moved. Drought, gloom, and night were numbered
among the injurious forces; the clear sky, the light,
and fertilising water were beneficent. The high spirits
of light, which gave new courage to the heart each
morning, and exhibited the world in fresh brilliance,
were praised with thanksgivings; the spirits of the
highest heaven, Mitra and Varuna, the guardians of
the world, the protectors of purity and justice, were
invoked earnestly, but less frequently than the warlike
victorious god who gave water, the god of storm
and tempest, who defeated the demons which obscured
the sky and wished to carry away the water (<small>IV.</small> 48).
His comrades in the fight were the morning wind
which drove away the clouds of night, the winds
which shattered the gloomy clouds, and swept them
from the sky. The spirit of fire, who by his brilliant
glow in the darkness of night kept off the beasts of
prey and fiends, who gathered men round the hearth,
and summoned the gods to the sacrifice, and carried
up to them the food of the sacrifice, received zealous
worship in the hymns of the Veda.</p>

<p>We can call to mind the invocations of the Rigveda
to Ushas, the goddess of the dawn, who drives forth
on the sky with red cows; to Surya and Savitar, the
spirits of the sun (IV. 45, 46). In the Avesta, prayers
are addressed to Ushahina and Hvare Kshaeta, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
bright sun-god. Ushahina is here the pure spirit of
the celestial dawn, "who is possessed of bright horses."
Of the sun-god we are told: "Mount, bright sun, with
thy swift horses, and shine for all creatures on the way
which Auramazda has created in the air, the way rich
in water which the gods have created;"<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> just as in the
Veda the sun is invoked to approach on his ancient
firm paths in the air, which are free from dust (IV. 46).
Sacrifice is offered to the sun, according to the Avesta,
when he rises above Hara berezaiti (the divine mountain).<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
The prayer to Mithra is as follows: "To the
mighty Yazata (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the worthy of prayer), the strong
one, who brings good, will I offer sacrifice with libations;
I will encompass him with songs of thanksgiving.
With libations we offer sacrifice to Mithra,
the lord of wide pastures, who speaketh true things, the
wise one, comely in shape, of a thousand ears and ten
thousand eyes, standing on a broad tower, strong, sleepless,
and watchful, who mounts above Hara berezaiti
before the immortal sun, the guider of horses&mdash;he who
first in a form of gold ascends the beautiful summits.
For him the creator Auramazda has prepared a dwelling
above Hara berezaiti, where is neither night, nor
darkness, nor winds chilling nor scorching, nor the corruption
of the slain; no filth created of demons nor
vapours ascend Hara berezaiti. From thence the giver
of good beholds the abode of the Arians, whose horse-guiding
lords govern splendid hosts, whose high mountains,
rich in water and in pastures, supply nourishment
for the ox, where are deep lakes with broad streams,
and wide navigable rivers burst forth in tumult, on
Iskata and Pourata,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> on Mouru (Merv), Haraeva<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
(p. 11), and Gao, &Ccedil;ughdha (Sogdiana), and Hvairiza (Choaresm).
Where first they sacrifice to him, there Mithra,
the lord of wide pastures, descends with the victorious
wind. From anguish and pain, O Mithra, carry us,
undeceived. Come to us for our protection; come to us
with joy; come to us with mercy; come to us with healing;
come to us with purification, the mighty, the strong,
the all-knowing, the tamer of dragons, the undeceived.
Never lulled to sleep, Mithra protects with his weapon
the creatures of Auramazda. On him the lord of the
land, of the canton, the village, the house, calls for
help with uplifted hands, whose voice of woe, whether
his voice be loud or soft, reaches up to the stars and
down to the earth. He to whom Mithra is favourable,
to him he cometh with aid; but with whomsoever he
is angry he destroys his house and village and canton
and land, and the glory of the land. Mithra gives
swift horses to those who do not deceive him; to the
habitation in which he is satisfied he gives troops of
cattle and men. The fire of Auramazda gives the
straightest path to those who do not deceive Mithra.
But if the lord of the house, the village, the canton,
the land deceives him, then Mithra in anger destroys
house and village, canton and land. Not all evil deeds,
not all deception, are seen by Mithra, saith the wicked
man. But Mithra sees all that is between heaven and
earth. With ten thousand eyes he beholds the man
who hates and deceives him. His long arms with the
might of Mithra grasp what is in Eastern India
(Hendu), and what is in Western, and what is in the
midst of this earth. The swiftest deceivers of Mithra
do not reach the goal; they do not escape on horseback,
nor reach the goal in chariots.</p>

<p>"Mithra, the lord of lands, whose countenance beams
like the star Tistrya, travels forth to the right end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the earth from the brilliant Garonmana (the abode of
the gods), equipped with golden helmet, and silver
coat of mail, with sharp long-shafted lance and swinging
arrow, on a beautiful chariot with a golden wheel
and silver spokes, which four white horses draw, their
fore-hoofs shod with gold, their hinder hoofs with
silver, harnessed in the yoke which is bent over them.
In his hand is a club with a hundred studs, and a hundred
blades, heavy at the end, making havoc of men;
bound with brass on the handle, mighty and golden,
the strongest and most victorious of weapons. Before
him goes Verethraghna in the form of a boar, sharp of
tusk, fat, enraged, striking at once with feet, claws, tail,
and back of brass.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Next to him goes the kindled fire,
the strong, royal grace. As a protection of the chariot
are a thousand bows of bone, whose strings are made
of the sinews of oxen, a thousand arrows plumed with
feathers of the Kahrka&ccedil;a, with golden points and
wooden shafts, and flakes of bone and iron, a thousand
lances with sharp points, a thousand missiles of
copper, a thousand two-edged swords. Strong as spirits
they travel onward, strong as spirits they fall on the
skulls of the Daevas.</p>

<p>"Before him of a truth, Angromainyu (the evil
spirit) trembles, the deadly one; before him trembles
Aeshma, the wicked-minded, and body-destroying;
before him trembles Bushyan&ccedil;ta, the long of hand,
and all invisible Daevas and the sinners from Varena.
When the evil one, who works wickedness, runs forth
with swift step, Mithra, the lord of wide pastures,
swiftly harnesses his chariot, and &Ccedil;raosha, the pure
and strong, and Nairyo&ccedil;angha, the herald, beats him
and his ranks. When Mithra comes where the lands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
are against him (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> do not honour him) he brings down
his club on horse and rider. Against them he brings
mighty destruction and terror; he bears away the
heads of the men who deceive Mithra. Their arrows,
swift-feathered, sent swiftly forth by the string from
the well-stretched bow, strike the air only; the lances,
sharp and running out with long shafts from the arm,
strike the air only; the missiles from the strings strike
the air only; the well-directed swords and well-slung
clubs beat the air only; meanwhile, angry, enraged,
and not propitiated, Mithra approaches, the lord of
wide pastures. Thou, O Mithra, angry and mighty,
takest the force from their arms; thou takest the force
from their arms, and the sight from their eyes, and
the hearing from their ears. The wind carries away
the lances which the opponents of Mithra throw; even
though he throws well and hits the body he inflicts
no wound. Standing on the field of battle Mithra
annihilates the ranks; the wings quake, and he makes
the centre to tremble. They say: Our war-horses were
led away by Mithra; by him were our strong arms
and swords annihilated. Mithra scares men before
and behind; &Ccedil;raosha, the pure, assists in slaying on
all sides. Mithra sweeps them away, slaying them by
fifties and by hundreds; by hundreds and by thousands;
by thousands and tens of thousands, and without
number. We cannot sustain the weight of the
angry lord who with the force of a thousand meets the
foe; who dashes on in his rage, and rests not from
the slaughter; who destroys all at a blow. May not
the mightiest, the swiftest, the most victorious of the
Yazatas fall upon us. Come to our help, O Mithra, high
lord, when the arrow hisses aloud and the horse neighs
in his nostrils, and the missiles whizz, and the strings
speed forth the sharp, bony arrows. Whomsoever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Mithra protects, him the well-sharpened lance cannot
reach, nor the arrow flying past him.</p>

<p>"In his might Mithra approaches; in power he goes
forth to dominion, and beholding from afar directs his
glance with his eyes. Thou protectest the lands which
seek after the beneficence of Mithra, lord of wide pastures;
thou destroyest the lands which are wicked. O
Mithra, lord of wide pastures, master of the house, of
the villages, the land!&mdash;let us be protectors of thy
fields, not the destroyers of them. As the sun arises
above Hara berezaiti so may I obtain my desires over
the evil Angromainyu. With uplifted arms, Mithra,
the lord of wide pastures, conveys us to immortality.
With sacrifice named by name, with becoming speech,
O strong Mithra, will I make offerings to thee with
libations. Listen, O Mithra, to our sacrifice. Come to
our sacrifice; come to our libations. Carry them away
to the place of meeting (<i>chinvat</i>); deposit them in
Garonmana. Thou, O Mithra, art the saviour and helper
of lands and men. Thou makest the dwellings, from
which impurity is removed, famous for women and
chariots. Thou hast power over the peace and the
disquiet of lands; prosperous art thou in the battle,
and strong. Give us the gifts for which we entreat
thee; abundance and power, prosperity and purity,
renown and bravery, and victory given by Ahura, the
overwhelming power of the highest purity (<i>asha vahista</i>),
and instruction in the sacred word, that so we may
slay all enemies and haters, and annihilate the hate of
men and Daevas, of magicians and Pairikas, of the
violent, blind, and deaf. Stretch out thy widely grasping
hand, O Mithra; thou art the protector of the
dwelling, and of them that deceive not. Protect us
in both worlds, the corporeal and incorporeal, from the
evil death, the evil Aeshma, the evil hosts, who seek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
to raise their cruel banners, from the attacks which
Aeshma may make with Vidhatu the Daeva-created."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>The modern traits which have been introduced into
this poem are easily distinguished and removed. The
relation in which Mithra is placed to Auramazda, the
chief of the good spirits, to the corporeal and incorporeal
world and the maintenance of the law, to Rashnu,
the spirit of justice, and other spirits of an abstract
nature, and to the instruction in the sacred word, are
like the "Western and Eastern India," obviously of the
later origin. Setting them aside, the old form of the
god of light of the Arians in Iran meets us in vigorous
and powerful outlines. Indeed we have here more
original conceptions of Mithra than in the Veda, and
find that idea of the god which formed part of the yet
undivided stock of the Arians in Iran and on the
Indus (IV. 51). In the Avesta Mithra is still in direct
conflict with the evil spirits, from which in the Veda
he is displaced by the storm-god, who first came into
prominence in the Panjab. That Mithra was once
the supreme deity of the Arians of Iran, is clear, not
only from his position as the most victorious opponent
of the demons, but also from the difficulty&mdash;which the
Avesta betrays in more than one passage&mdash;of subordinating
him to Auramazda, who subsequently became
supreme, and establishing the precedence of the latter.
In Mithra's habitation it is never night. Highest of
the spirits of light, he goes before the sun, and first
plants himself on the summits of the mountains. He
is the mightiest warrior against night and the spirits
of night who tremble before him. His light overpowers
and destroys them. Thus he is able to give victory
in the battle to the army which worships him in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
truth; the host with which he fights he fills with
courage and power; that with which he is angry he
fills with terror, and causes their arrows to fly forth
in vain. In brilliant armour he travels onward, his
club in his hand; before him is victory, and beside
him is fire. Mithra's club is called Vazra, Indra's club
is Vajra; the word is the same, the distinction is due to
the change of sound which separates the old Bactrian
from the language of the Veda and Sanskrit.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Lord
of the lands and nations, he looks down on the abode
of the Arians; most brilliant of deities, he sees all
that is between heaven and earth. He cannot be
deceived and beguiled; the most secret wickedness is
not hidden from him; the swiftest criminal does not
escape from him, and the strongest succumbs to his
anger. God of purity and truth, he watches over
purity and truth among men, punishes falsehood,
rewards justice and fidelity; he blesses the nations and
houses which worship him with goodly increase in
men and flocks.</p>

<p>We saw what importance the Veda ascribed to the
conquest over Vritra, the cloud serpent, the black
demon. The Arians in Iran also are acquainted with
the slaying of Vritra. The prayer to Mithra represents
Verethraghna as going before Mithra's victorious car
(p. 110). Verethraghna means slayer of Verethra, or
Vritra, and is the same word as Vritrahan. Hence
the attribute of Indra, which denotes the most important
achievement among his actions, is among the
Iranians an independent spirit. As the club of Indra
belongs in the Avesta to Mithra, so is Verethraghna
his companion. No doubt at one time Mithra had himself
the surname Verethraghna in Iran, the attribute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
signifying the conqueror of the worst and strongest of
the evil spirits. But just as in the Panjab, owing to
the tropical storms of that region, the form of Vritra
came into prominence, and with it the form of Indra,
so in the Avesta did Verethraghna fade away when
separated from Mithra. Here Verethraghna is only
the victorious strength, the conquest and slaughter
of the enemy,&mdash;victory itself. Verethraghna is the
best armed of the heavenly spirits, the strongest in
might, the most victorious. Yet even in the Avesta
the Soma is offered to Verethraghna before the battle,
as in the Veda it is offered to Indra. Auramazda
says to Zarathrustra: "When the armies meet in
battle, the orderly ranks are not defeated in which
sacrifice is liberally offered to Verethraghna, whom
Ahura created. The Arian lands should offer him
sacrifice, and strew sacrificial branches for him. They
should offer beasts to him, bright and gold-coloured."
"To him the pure Zarathrustra offered sacrifice, and
Verethraghna came to him in the form of a strong
wind, in the form of a beautiful bull with golden ears
and golden hoofs, in the form of a shining horse, of
a large, biting, and fierce camel, in the form of a boar
with strong tusks (as also in the prayer to Mithra), in
the form of a youth, in the form of a man carrying a
sword with a golden handle, in the form of the swiftest
and largest of birds, in the form of a ram, and a
fighting goat. And Verethraghna gave Zarathrustra
strength of arms, health and vigour of body, and
power of vision, like that of the horse which sees
in the night, and the gold-coloured vulture." In the
battle Verethraghna hastens through the ranks and
inquires with Mithra and Rashnu: "Who lies against
Mithra? to whom shall I give death and destruction,
for I have the power?" "Verethraghna, the created of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Ahura, the bearer of splendour, I will praise"&mdash;such
is a prayer in the Avesta&mdash;"with audible praise, with
offering. To Verethraghna will I sacrifice. I will bring
Haoma in order that I may conquer this army, which
comes up behind me. Verethraghna holds back the
hands of the ranks of the men who lie against Mithra;
he veils their sight, and dulls their ears, and suffers not
their feet to advance. Verethraghna brings the ranks
together in battle; he destroys the ranks, and annihilates
them."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>In the Veda, the winds, the swift and strong Maruts,
aided Indra against the demons; Vayu, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
blowing, the morning wind which chases away the
dark clouds, was Indra's charioteer (IV. 49). In the
Avesta also, Vayu, who blows before the morning
light and the sun, and scares away the goblins of the
night, who first drinks "the Soma draught at the
morning sacrifice," takes a prominent position, and
under his Vedic name. The heroes of ancient days
cried aloud to Vayu for victory, and he brought help
to them all. He is the strongest of the strong, the
swiftest of the swift, girded up and active, higher in
stature, broader in the hips and shoulders, than the
rest of the gods. He sits on a golden throne (p. 35);
wears a golden helmet, golden armour, a girdle and
neckband of gold, and rides on a golden chariot. He
says to Zarathrustra: "I am called the beneficent,
because I do good for Auramazda. I am called the
pure, the strong-winged, the mightiest, the swiftest, the
powerful for defeat, the expeller of the Daevas. I am
called the Hurling one, the Biting one, the sharp
lance, the flashing lance. I am called the Conqueror.
These names must thou invoke at the shock of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
ranks in battle, in the stress of the conflict."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> In the
Avesta, as we saw, Verethragna also appears in the
form of the wind. The "pure swift winds," the air,
"which works on high, which purifies the heaven
from the right hand," are frequently invoked; the
"strong wind, created by Ahura," brings the rain-clouds
which Tistrya (p. 120) has liberated over the
earth; the wind carries away the lances, which those
hurl who are hostile to Mithra. We saw above, how
the Bactrians were defeated by Artaxerxes I., "because
the wind blew in their faces" (p. 25). If in the
Avesta, in accordance with the character of the
doctrine, the purifying force of the winds and fresh
air is made prominent, the other traits quoted are
sufficient to permit us to recognise the original conception
formed by the Iranians of the spirits of the winds.</p>

<p>The pure waters, the well-flowing, the waters of the
springs, pools, and rivers are often mentioned in the
Avesta and highly extolled. As with the Arians in
India, so in the Avesta, the great waters are placed high
up in the sky. The stars contain the seed of water; just
as among the Arians in India certain constellations at the
appearance of which rain fell, were considered to be the
home of the waters. In the Avesta also the water of
the sky is the source and origin of the waters on earth.
In that book a female deity is the guardian of these
waters, the goddess Ardvi&ccedil;ura Anahita, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the lofty,
stainless one, "to whom Auramazda gave the waters in
charge." She is at one and the same time the source
of the heavenly water, which springs up on the golden
height of Hukairya, the summit of the divine mountain,
and the spirit of this source and of the water
coming from it. At the height of a thousand men,
the spring Ardvi&ccedil;ura flows down from the golden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Hukairya; it has a thousand basins, and a thousand
streams, each stream is forty days' journey in length
for an active traveller.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The goddess who pours out this
water is a strong, well-grown maiden of brilliant countenance,
and beautiful arms, which are more brilliant
and larger than horses. On her brow she bears a
golden diadem, adorned with a hundred stars; she has
golden ear-rings and neck-band, a flowing lower garment
with many folds of gold, and golden shoes on her feet.
Her breasts fall down over her girdle; her upper robe
is of bright otter skins, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the smooth skins of the
animal of the water. She carries a golden Paitidana,
and holds the reins of her chariot which is drawn by
four white beasts of draught. The deity of the water
of the sky is in the Avesta the most beneficent of the
goddesses; the source of water is also the source of
fruitfulness and life. She cleanses the seed of men,
and gives a happy delivery to women; those who are
with child entreat her assistance. To men she gives
swift horses and strong comrades, if duly invoked and
worshipped. We have already seen how the heroes
of old days, Yima, Thraetaona, Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa, Kava U&ccedil;a,
Kava Hu&ccedil;rava, Vista&ccedil;pa, sacrificed horses, cows, and
smaller cattle to Ardvi&ccedil;ura, in order to win victory
over the evil spirits, the dragons, the giants, and the
enemies of Iran (p. 32, 34 ff.). Zarathrustra asks the
stainless Ardvi&ccedil;ura what sacrifice he must offer to her,
in order that Auramazda may not hold back his course
in the height above the sun, that serpents may not
injure the water by their sweat and poison. And
Ardvi&ccedil;ura gave command that prayer and sacrifice
should be offered to her from the ascent of the sun till
daybreak; the sacrifice was to be consumed by the
sacrificers and priests in honour of the goddess; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
impure, blind, dumb, and all afflicted with infirmities
were to be kept far from it. "Come to me, come down,
Ardvi&ccedil;ura," is the invocation, "from the stars to the
earth which Auramazda made; to thee, the excellent,
mighty lords of the lands, the sons of the lords of the
lands, will offer sacrifice."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>The divine mountain, on which the Ardvi&ccedil;ura rises,
is in the Avesta "the mighty navel of water (<i>apam
napal</i>)," "in a course swift as the horse, Auramazda
causes the water to stream forth from it." On this
mountain is the deep lake Vourukasha, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> having
wide shores, in which the waters collect together. Out
of this lake the water-clouds rise, which are to bring
the fertilising rain to the earth. Though the tropic
storms are wanting in Iran, the fertilising of the land
by the water of the springs, rivers, and lakes, and by
rain was of no less importance there than in the Panjab.
Hence in the Avesta we again meet with the contest
of the good spirits against Vritra, and in Iran also
these spirits are opposed to the demons of blight. It
is demons of this kind, which, according to the Avesta,
keep back the rain-clouds above Vourukasha, and men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
say: "When will Tistrya (Sirius) rise, the bright, the
majestic, the lord of the stars? When will the streams
of water flow which are stronger than horses?" And
Tistrya, whom Angromainyu slays not, nor the magicians
and Pairikas, nor the magicians among men,
gleams forth from the navel of the waters; he runs to
Lake Vourukasha like an arrow, in the form of a horse,
a beautiful brilliant horse, with yellow ears, and
golden horse-cloth. Auramazda and Mithra prepare
the way for him. Ashi vanguhi and Parendi follow in
his wake with swift chariots. There goes to meet him
the Daeva Apaosha, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the witherer, in the form of a
black, bald horse, with bald ears, bald back and tail,
and ugly brand. For three days and three nights
they struggle; and the Daeva Apaosha scares away
the brilliant Tistrya from Lake Vourukasha for the
distance of a <i>Hathra</i>. And Tistrya speaks and says:
"If men honour me with the sacrifice named by name,
with duly performed sacrifice, and prayer, then at the
appointed time I shall come to the pure men; hostile
chariots and uplifted banners will not come nigh to the
Arian lands, and I shall have gained the strength of
ten horses, ten bulls, ten mountains, and ten flowing
waters." And Auramazda sacrificed to Tistrya and
brought him that strength, and Tistrya fought with
the Daeva Apaosha till midday, and conquered and
overpowered him, and scared him away from Vourukasha.
And Tistrya announced blessing for the waters
and the trees; the streams of the waters will come
to you without opposition, the cloud rises out of
Lake Vourukasha, and the vapours gather above on
Mount Hendava in the midst of Lake Vourukasha, and
Tistrya drives forth the vapours, the pure ones, whence
clouds are formed, and the strong wind drives clouds
and rain to the villages and hamlets, to the seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Kareshvare (the seven parts of the earth). And Auramazda
gave command to Zarathrustra that the Arian
lands should offer sacrifice to Tistrya, should sprinkle
sacrificial rice, and sacrifice a bright, light-hued, Haoma-coloured
animal in order that he might withstand the
Pairika Dushyairya (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> blight). "If I had not
created Tistrya," Auramazda says, "this Pairika would
have carried on war day and night, but Tistrya binds
her with two and three fetters." "We praise Tistrya,
the brilliant majestic star, which drives away the
Pairika; he blows her away from Lake Vourukasha;
then the clouds draw up, spreading themselves afar,
which contain the fertilising water."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Another spirit which fights against the demons in
the Avesta is called &Ccedil;raosha. On the divine mountain
stands "his triumphant dwelling with a thousand
pillars, on the topmost height of the great mountain,
illumined within with a light of its own, decked with
stars without;" his chariot is drawn by four spotless
horses, which are swifter than clouds, swifter than
winds, swifter than storms, swifter than birds with
strong wings. A strong, well-armed, victorious youth,
the strongest and swiftest among young men, who
fears not the Daevas, and before whom they fly in
terror to the darkness, &Ccedil;raosha is the companion of
Mithra; with him he overthrows the ranks of the
hosts with whom Mithra is angry (p. 111). Thrice in
each day he comes to smite the Daevas, with the axe
of a woodman in his hand. Thus he fights against the
evil Angromainyu, against Aeshma, and the Daevas
Kunda, Banga, and Vibanga; thus he forces the conquered
Daevi Druj to answer him. In the dark he is
wakeful against the evil ones; he protects the world from
them when the sun has set; in each night he comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
thrice upon the earth with his weapons in his hand.
About the third watch of the night he arouses the
bird Parodarsh, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the cock, that by his cry he may
scare away the goblins of the night, and may banish the
Daevi Bushyan&ccedil;ta, which holds men imprisoned in
sleep.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> &Ccedil;raosha, moreover, protects the sacrifices which
are offered to the good gods, and which the evil one
would carry away or defile. One of the priests who
took part in the sacred ceremonies held a club, the
&Ccedil;raosha-club, in his hand, in order to scare the demons
and keep them back. Of the two instruments which
in the book of the law are used for flagellation, and by
which the evil spirits are driven from the bodies of men,
one is called the &Ccedil;raosha-whip (<i>&Ccedil;raosha charana</i>).</p>

<p>We remember the numerous hymns of the Veda
which celebrate the benefits conferred upon men by
Agni, the spirit of fire, who is born from the double
wood, and descends to earth in the lightning from the
water-bed of the storm-cloud; the glow of this bright
youth preserves men from beasts of prey, from murderers
and evil spirits, helps the gods to victory, and
contends in battle in the van; at the same time a
royal house-lord and priest, Agni is in the Veda the
upholder of the religious worship, the mediator between
heaven and earth (IV. 40). The Avesta is filled with
similar conceptions, though less poetical in form. Here
the power as victorious of fire against the demon takes
the first place. We saw that Mithra's chariot carried
the kindled fire. "The sacred, strong fire" is invoked
as a "warrior," as a "protector," as a slayer of the evil
spirits, as the giver of good. To whatever side, we
are told in the book of the law, the wind carries the
smoke of the fire, it comes back thence as a slayer of
thousands. "Happy is the man," we are told in an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
invocation, "to whom thou comest in strength, O Fire,
son of Auramazda, more friendly than the friendliest,
worthy beyond others of supplication. O Fire, we
approach thee with perfect purity, with a good spirit;
mayest thou come down to us bringing help."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> He
who uses dry selected wood for the fire, him the fire
blesses, saying: "May herds of cattle gather round
thee, and abundance of men; may all things succeed
according to the wish of thy soul. Live out thy life
happily to the full extent to which thou wilt live.
The fire speaks with all those for whom it shines the
whole night through, and cooks food; from all it
demands good nourishment. The fire looks on the
hands of all who come; what does the friend bring to
the friend, he who approaches to him who sits alone?<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>"
The Gathas of the Avesta also speak of the pieces of
wood for friction, out of which springs the fire that
shows the way;<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> and in another passage we hear of the
fire Urvazista which dwells in wood. The Avesta distinguishes
between the fire &Ccedil;penista, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the house-lord,
the hearth-fire (it is the same name that is given
to the hearth-fire in India), the most victorious fire
Verethraghna, which slays all the demons, and by
which, according to the custom of the Parsees, the fires
of the hearth must be renewed year by year, and the fire
of lightning, which is called Vazista. This last, which
comes down direct from heaven, is the "most sacred
of all fires, which slays the demon &Ccedil;penjaghra."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In
the Avesta the priests are called Athravas, a name
which, no doubt, goes back to the worship of fire
(<i>athar</i>); among the Indians Atharvan entices the fire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
from the wood, and together with Manu and Dadhyanch
kindles the first sacrificial fire; the fourth
Veda is called after him (IV. 280). In the Avesta also
the red glowing fires, which gleamed on the earth in
the days of King Yima, are repeatedly mentioned
(p. 32); it extols "the brilliance of the Arian lands,"
denotes the fire-priests as possessors of the true faith,
and assures us that what is right may be known from
the clear, blazing flames.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>The sacrifice offered by the Arians beyond the
Indus to Indra, the Maruts, and spirits of light, to
strengthen them against the demons, the draught prepared
from the Soma, is known to us; we have shown
how this Soma which strengthens the gods became
itself a god in the fancy of the Indians&mdash;a mighty
nourisher and sustainer of the gods. The same custom
and deity are found in the Avesta, only the name has
become Haoma, according to the phonetic laws of the
Bactrian language. The legend has already shown us
what importance was ascribed in Iran to the worship of
the god Haoma, and the sacrifice of this liquor. Yima
was born to Vivanghana as a reward because he had
first poured out the Haoma and worshipped the god.
To Athwya, the second worshipper of Haoma, Thraetaona
was born; and to Thrita, the third, Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa,
the hero (p. 27, 28). To Zarathrustra, who was born to
Pourusha&ccedil;pa for a similar service, when he is dressing
the sacred fire at the break of dawn, and singing the
sacred hymns, the god Haoma appears: "Who art
thou," asks Zarathrustra, "who appearest to my sight
as the most perfect in the corporeal world, with thy
brilliant, immortal body?" Haoma answered him: "I
am the pure Haoma, who protect men from evil. Call
on me, press out my juice in order to enjoy me; praise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
me as all other fire-priests praise me." Then said Zarathrustra:
"Supplication to Haoma! Haoma, the good,
is well-created; duly-created is he, and gives health;
he bestows kindness, is victorious, and of golden colour.
Thy wisdom, O golden one, I praise; thy strength, thy
victory, thy healing power, thy greatness. I praise
the mountains, the high ones, where thou, Haoma,
growest; I praise the earth, the wide and patient, thy
mother, O pure Haoma. Mayest thou grow on the
paths of the birds. To the horsemen, who spur their
horses, Haoma gives power and strength; to the
maidens who have long remained unmarried, he gives
true and vigorous husbands, gifted with good understanding,
and to wives beautiful children and a pure
posterity. To those who repeat the Na&ccedil;kas (the
chapters of the Avesta) he gives sanctity and greatness.
Praise to thee, Haoma; thou knowest the words
which are spoken with truth. Praise to thee, Haoma,
who by thine own power art a mighty king. To thee
Auramazda first gave the girdle glittering with stars;
girt with this thou lingerest on the summits of the
mountains in order to maintain in sincerity the commands
of the sacred sayings. O Haoma, lord of the
house, of the village, of the land, lord of wisdom, I call
on thee for greatness and victory, for favour to my
body, and rich food. O thou who art of golden colour,
I entreat thee for skill and power, passing through the
whole body, for beauty and health, for prosperity and
increase, for greatness spreading over the whole form.
The first boon for which I entreat thee, O Haoma, who
removest death, is that I may attain to the excellent
habitation of the saints, the bright dwelling where there
is abundance of all good things; the second boon is
that this body may endure; the third, that my life may
be long; the fourth, that I may go through the earth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
powerful and glad, troubling the tormentors, and slaying
the Druj; the fifth is that I may walk victorious on
the earth and slay the evil. For this thing also, as a
sixth boon, O Haoma, who removest death, I entreat
thee: may I be the first to see the thief, the murderer,
and the wolf: may none of these previously see me.
Keep far from us the hatred of those who hate us; tear
out the hearts of those who give poison. If in this house,
this place, this village, this sacrifice, there is a man who
does harm, take from him the power to go, obscure his
reason, break asunder his heart with the commandment.
Let him not be mighty in the feet, let him not be
mighty in the hands. O Haoma, I make a prayer to
thee, that thou mayest go a sovereign lord through the
worlds, triumphing over hatred and the evil. Thou
shouldest triumph over the hatred of all who hate thee,
over the hatred of the Daevas and men, the evil spirits
and magicians, the perverse, blind, and dumb, the two-footed
murderers and insidious creatures, the four-footed
wolves, and the numerous hosts which creep
and fly."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Further, we find in the Avesta that the "priest"
offers Haoma to Mithra, &Ccedil;raosha, and Drva&ccedil;pa on the
divine mountain.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The plant of which this god is the
genius, grows, according to the books of the Parsees,
as white heavenly Haoma only on the tree Gaokerena,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the heavenly tree which stands on the divine
mountain or in the spring Ardvi&ccedil;ura; the yellow
Haoma which grows upon the earth is only a copy or
descendant of the white Haoma. In Iran also the preparation
and expression of the Haoma juice is accompanied
by a long and minute ritual; and the offering of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the sacrifice, which is still performed among the Parsees
of India, requires long invocations and responses
between the celebrant and the ministering priests. At
the present day the Parsees send from time to time
one of their priests to Kerman in order to bring from
their ancient home twigs of Haoma for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>The coincidence which we find above, in the forms
of the legend, between the Avesta and the Veda&mdash;Vivanghana,
Yima, Athwya, Thrita, Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa, and
U&ccedil;a are found in both&mdash;is not less marked in the
conceptions of the gods and their functions, and in
the character of the worship. There can be no doubt
that the Arians of Iran believed themselves to be protected
and injured by the same spirits as the Arians
in the Panjab. If on the Indus invocations were addressed
to Vritrahan, Vayu, the Maruts, and Mitra, in
Iran men prayed to Verethraghna, Vayu, and Mithra.
In both places Vritra and Ahi are the opponents of
the god of light; in both fire was worshipped; in both
the power of the sacrificial liquor was elevated into a
mighty life-giving god. Among the Indians, as we
saw, the priest who addresses the invocation to the
god at the sacrifice is called Hotar; in the Avesta
the Zaotar utters the prayers. Further coincidences
in the number and nature of the gods, in the worship,
in the laws and forms of purification, in the ceremonial,
and even in the shape of the universe, will
show themselves as we proceed. It is true that
differences may also be found. Many of the numerous
spirits of the Rigveda are wanting in the Avesta;
and again, some spirits in the Avesta, such as Anahita,
&Ccedil;raosha, Tistrya, are unknown to the Indians. Variations
such as these must occur where there has been
a separate development from a common root. But
the factors in the coincidence of the most important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
forms of the gods and heroes, and the distinctive
modes of worship, in the Avesta and the Rigveda,
the very oldest monument of the Arians in India,
are so great that any doubt whether the Avesta
remained free from alterations and influences of an
alien or later nature in the revision under Shapur
II., is entirely removed, and we know that we possess
in it the remains of an original document of Iran,
going back beyond the time of Cyrus. In the Avesta
we have before us the faithful expression of the
ancient Iranian faith. Though not in its original form
this result is the more certain, because on the one
hand some deities, as for instance Mithra, and some
myths like that of Yima, exhibit older forms in the
Avesta than in the Rigveda, while in others we have
almost an identity of language between the two. In
the Avesta as in the Veda the Soma is praised as
"gold-coloured;" in both fire is the "house-lord;"
the sun goes on his "path free from dust;" the power
of the gods is increased by the sacrifice (p. 120). In
both one god offers sacrifice to another, in order to
strengthen him; and the invocations of the Avesta,
like those of the Rigveda, ask for health and long
life for the suppliant; for possessions and wealth and
favour, for the power to see the thief, the murderer,

Aban Yasht, notwithstanding the swelling breasts, shows how definitely
the form of Anahita belongs to the Iranian conception, how peculiarly
this goddess of fountains is represented in this form, and how intimately
connected she is with the whole Iranian system of the boon of water,
and the legends of the heroes. A brass tablet found at Gr&auml;chwyl in
the canton of Berne, which exhibits the Persian Artemis with swelling
breasts, surrounded by four lions, with a bird of prey on her head and
serpents instead of ears, and wings on the shoulders, has decided J.
Stickel ("De monumento Graechwyliano") to regard the Persian
Artemis as identical with the Semitic goddess of birth. This tablet is
due to the syncretism of Roman times. Certain similarities between
the Syrian goddess of birth and fertility, Mylitta-Derceto, and the
Persian goddess of water, might lead to such a syncretism even under
the Ach&aelig;menids, and this coincidence might determine Artaxerxes
Mnemon to erect images of Anahita in Ecbatana and Susa after the
pattern of the Semites. Beros. fragm., 16 ed. M&uuml;ller, and below.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE REFORM OF THE FAITH.</h3>


<p>In the Gathas of the Avesta the spirit who keeps
watch over the increase of the flocks speaks to the
heavenly powers, saying: "All creatures are distressed;
whom have ye for their assistance?" Auramazda
makes answer: "I have one only who has received
my commands, the holy Zarathrustra; he will proclaim
my exhortations and those of Mazda and Asha, for
I will make him practised in speech."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Then Auramazda
sacrificed to Ardvi&ccedil;ura that he might unite
with Zarathrustra the son of Pourusha&ccedil;pa, to the end
that the latter might think, speak, and act according
to the law.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Pourusha&ccedil;pa, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> rich in horses, of the
race of Haechata&ccedil;pa,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> was the fourth who offered the
sacrifice of Haoma in Airyana Vaeja after Vivanghana,
Athwya, and Thrita. For this Zarathrustra was born
to him.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> At his birth and his growth the grass and
the trees increased, and all the creatures of Auramazda
greeted each other because the priest had been created
who would sacrifice for them and spread abroad the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
law of Auramazda, over the seven Kareshvare of the
earth.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> &Ccedil;raosha, accompanied by the sublime Asha,
appeared to Zarathrustra, and the latter declared himself
ready to swear enmity against the liars, and to be
a mighty source of help to the truth. And the god
Haoma appeared to Zarathrustra and commanded him
to press out his juice and to praise him, as other fire-priests
praise him. And Zarathrustra praised Haoma
and his mother the earth, and addressed six prayers
to him (p. 125). Ashi vanguhi also came at Zarathrustra's
command on her chariot, and inquired:
"Who art thou who callest on me, whose speech is the
most beautiful which I have heard from all those who
invoke me? Come nearer to me; approach my chariot."
Then she surrounded him with her right arm and her
left and said: "Beautiful art thou, Zarathrustra, well
grown, with strong legs and long arms. To thy body
has been given brilliance, and to thy soul long prosperity."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
And when Zarathrustra sacrificed to Verethraghna,
he granted him strength of arm, health, and
vigour of body, and power of vision, such as that of
the horse, which sees by night, and the gold-coloured
vulture.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> But Auramazda taught Zarathrustra "the
best words," prayers, and invocations, and charms
against the evil spirits.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> "How," Zarathrustra inquires
of Auramazda, "how ought I to protect the
creatures from the evil spirits, from the wicked Angromainyu?"
Then Auramazda answers: "Praise
Auramazda, the creator of the pure creation; praise
the victorious Mithra; praise the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas (the
immortal saints), which rule over the seven parts of
the earth; praise the holy &Ccedil;raosha, who holds the club
against the head of the Daevas; praise Verethraghna,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
created by Ahura, the bearer of the splendour; praise
the shining heavens, and the glowing Tistrya; praise
Vayu, the swift; praise &Ccedil;penta Armaiti (the holy
earth), the beautiful daughter of Auramazda. Praise
the tree, the good, the pure, created by Ahura, the
well-grown and strong; praise the glittering Haetumant
(Etymandros); praise Yima Kshaeta, the
possessor of good herds. Praise the good laws, the
law against the Daevas, the law of the worshippers of
Auramazda; praise the splendour of the Arian land;
praise the abode of the pure. Praise the fire Vazista
(p. 123), which smites the Daeva &Ccedil;penjaghra. Bring
hard wood and perfumes, and water of purification to
the fire."<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Zarathrustra first proclaimed the words which
Auramazda had taught him to Maidhyomao,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> the son
of Ara&ccedil;ta, his father's brother, and spoke to the
members of his race, the Haechata&ccedil;pas: "Ye holy
Haechata&ccedil;pas, to you will I speak; ye distinguish the
right and the wrong." The announcement did not
remain confined to the circle of the family and the
race: "To you that come," we are told in another
passage, "I will announce the praises of the all-wise
lord, and the praises of Vohumano. Look on the
beams of fire with pious mind. The fair sayings of
the fire-priests are the way of Vohumano. Thou
gavest ancient sayings, O Ahura; by these will I
annihilate among you the sacrifices of the lying gods.
The worshipper of fire should accurately understand
the correct words which have come from Vohumano
(the good disposition and its spirit) in order that
truth may be his portion." In other poems Zarathrustra
laments: "The liar possesses the fields of
the true man, who protects the earth; none of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
servants worship me; none of the lords of the land,
who are unbelievers. The dominion is in the hands of
the priests and prophets of the lying gods; whither
shall I go for refuge?&mdash;to what land shall I turn? I
cry for help for Frashaostra and myself. May the fire
grant this help to both of us."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Frashaostra of the
race of Hvova, is mentioned in the Avesta as the
closest adherent of Zarathrustra, and often in connection
with Jama&ccedil;pa. The help for which Zarathrustra
cried in this invocation was granted to him
by King Vista&ccedil;pa. Zarathrustra offered the Haoma
draught in Airyana Vaeja to Ardvi&ccedil;ura, and prayed
to her: "Grant to me that I may combine with the
son of Aurvata&ccedil;pa, the strong Kava Vista&ccedil;pa, to the
end that he may think, speak, and act according to
the law;" and the goddess granted him this favour.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
And Zarathrustra sacrificed to the Drva&ccedil;pa (the goddess
of flocks) in Airyana Vaeja, to the end that he
might unite with the good and noble Hutao&ccedil;a (the
wife of Vista&ccedil;pa), that she might impress the good
law on her memory.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Finally, we read: "Who is
thy true friend on the great earth; who will proclaim
it? Kava Vista&ccedil;pa, the warlike, will do this."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Of King Vista&ccedil;pa and Frashaostra the Avesta then
tells us, "that they prepared the right path for the
faith which Ahura gave to the fire-priests." In the
prayers Kava Vista&ccedil;pa is praised because as an arm,
an assister, and helper, he has subjected himself to
the law of Ahura, the law of Zarathrustra; because he
has opened a wide path for purity, and has established
the law in the world. The mighty brilliance of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
ruler supported Zarathrustra, "in establishing the law
and making it highly esteemed."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> When Jama&ccedil;pa saw
the army of the Daeva-worshippers approach, he sacrificed
to Ardvi&ccedil;ura a hundred horses, a thousand
oxen, and ten thousand head of small cattle, and
Ardvi&ccedil;ura granted to him to fight victoriously against
all the non-Arians. And Zairivairi, the brother of
Vista&ccedil;pa, besought Ardvi&ccedil;ura that he might smite the
skilful Peshana, who worshipped the Daevas, and
Arejata&ccedil;pa. Kava Vista&ccedil;pa himself offered sacrifice
in order to obtain the victory over Asta-aurva, over the
Daeva worshippers &Ccedil;pinjauruska, and Darsinika, and
the murderous Arejata&ccedil;pa.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> And Vista&ccedil;pa smote
Peshana and Arejata&ccedil;pa, and Zarathrustra blessed
him: "I praise thee, O ruler of the lands. May life
be given to thy wives and thy children, which shall
be born from thy body. Be thou possessed of swift
horses, like the sun, shining like the moon, glowing
as fire, sharp as Mithra, a conqueror of enemies like
Verethraghna, well grown and victorious as &Ccedil;raosha.
Mayest thou be a ruler like Yima; mayest thou be
victorious and rich in cattle like Thraetaona, bold and
strong as Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa, wise as Urvakshaya, brilliant as
Kava U&ccedil;a, without sickness and death, like Kava
Hu&ccedil;rava, stainless as &Ccedil;yavarshana, rich in horses as
Pourusha&ccedil;pa, a friend of the heavenly ones, and
conqueror of men."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>The Avesta gives Zarathrustra three sons: Urvatatnara,
Hvare&ccedil;ithra, Daevotbi (Punisher of the Daevas);
and three daughters: Freni, Thriti, and Pourushi&ccedil;ta.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
His work is summed up in the fact that he compelled
the Daevas, who previously had been in human form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
upon the earth, to hide themselves in the earth.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> His
doctrine prevents the Daevas from injuring the creation,
as before, and gives to all the creatures of the
good god the means of protecting themselves more
effectually against the evil. Hence Zarathrustra is
the increaser of life; in this sense he is described,
invoked, and worshipped as the lord and master of
all created life. But in time &Ccedil;aoshyant will be born,
who will make the evil creatures wholly powerless,
and bring on for man the time of undisturbed happiness,
in which there will no more be any battle;
the time of uninterrupted life, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of immortality.
In this period all who once had life will have life
again; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the life destroyed by Angromainyu and
the evil spirits will be restored, and the dead will rise
to a new life.</p>

<p>Zarathrustra's birth and growth struck terror into
the evil spirit Angromainyu. "The Yazatas" (the
gods), he exclaimed, "have not forced me from the
earth, crossed with paths, round, and wide-reaching;
but Zarathrustra will drive me from it."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> And the
Daevas took counsel on the summit of Arezura, whither
they are wont to come together from their caves with
the Druj: "Alas! in the dwelling of Pourusha&ccedil;pa
the pure Zarathrustra has been born. He is the
weapon with which the Daevas are smitten; he takes
away the power from the Daevi Druj, and the Daevi
Na&ccedil;u (&#957;&#941;&#1008;&#965;&#962;, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the spirit of the dead), and the false
lies; how shall we compass his death?" And from
the region of the north Angromainyu dashed forward,
who is full of death, the Daeva of Daevas, and said:
"O Druj, go up and slay the pure Zarathrustra."
And "Zarathrustra said in the spirit: The wicked, evil-minded
Daevas are considering my death. And he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
arose and went forth, bearing in his hand stones of
the size of a Kata, which he had received from the
creator Auramazda, and he praised the good waters of
the good creation, and the law of the worshippers of
Auramazda, and uttered the prayer: <i>Yatha ahu vairyo</i>.
The Druj ran round about him, and the Daeva Buiti,
the deceiver of mortals; and the Druj ran in alarm
from him and said to Angromainyu, the tormentor:
In him, in the holy Zarathrustra, I see no death.
And Zarathrustra said to Angromainyu: Evil-minded
Angromainyu, I will smite the creation which is created
by the Daevas; I will smite the spirit of the dead
which the Daevas have created, until &Ccedil;aoshyant the
victorious shall be born from the water of Kan&ccedil;ava,
in the region of the east. Angromainyu answered
him: Wherewith wilt thou smite my creatures? With
what weapons wilt thou destroy them? Then spake
Zarathrustra: The pestle, the bowl, the Haoma, these
are my best weapons, and the words which Auramazda
has spoken. By this sacred word will I annihilate thy
creatures, O evil Angromainyu. Slay not my creatures,
O pure Zarathrustra, answered Angromainyu.
Thou art the son of Pourusha&ccedil;pa, and hast life from a
mother. Curse the good law of the worshippers of
Auramazda, and attain the prosperity which Vadhaghna
has attained, the ruler of the lands. But
Zarathrustra spake: I will not curse the good law of
the worshippers of Auramazda; no, not though my
bones and soul and power of life were torn asunder.
Then the evil Daevas ran and took counsel on the
summit of Arezura, and Angromainyu spoke: What
will the Daevas bring thither? But they said: 'The
evil eye;' and hastened to the bottom of hell, the
dark, the evil, the wicked."<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>With Zarathrustra, according to the Avesta, a new
era begins. He is the proclaimer of a new law. But
along with this we are told that even in Yima's time
the earth glowed with red fires; the power of the old
sayings of the fire-priests is extolled; the professors of
the first, and those of the new law receive commendation.
Zarathrustra is born to his father as a reward
for offering an ancient sacrifice, the sacrifice of Haoma.
He himself dresses the fire at daybreak before he
comes forth to announce his new doctrine; and even
while announcing it he sacrifices to the old gods
Verethraghna and Ardvi&ccedil;ura; the gods whom the
heroes of the old days invoke appear to him also, the
prophet of the new teaching; they demand that he
shall offer sacrifice, and insist on their worship; they
grant him favour and gifts. It is precisely the ancient
sacrifice of Haoma, the common possession of the Arians
in Iran and India, which is declared by Zarathrustra
to be the best means of repelling the evil ones, and
not Zarathrustra only, but also Auramazda sacrifices
to an ancient divinity that the son of Pourusha&ccedil;pa
may be obedient to his commands, and then directs
the latter to invoke the ancient gods, Mithra, Verethragna,
&Ccedil;raosha, Vayu, and Tistrya, and to worship
fire. Hence it was no new religion which Zarathrustra
taught; it was nothing more than a reform of the
ancient faith, and traditional modes of worship.</p>

<p>We were able definitely to ascertain from the fragments
of the Avesta that it arose in the east of Iran;
the districts of the north-east are especially prominent
in it. It denotes Bactra as the abode of dominion
(p. 31). A doctrine which, as we shall see, lays the
greatest stress on the cultivation of the land, could not
have grown up in the deserts of the Gedrosians, or
the steppes of the Sagartians. If, according to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Avesta, "the evil custom of the burial of the dead
prevails" in Arachosia (Harahvaiti);<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> if Haetumat
(Drangiana) is reproved for the sins which are practised
there;<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> if we are told of Haraeva (the land of the
Arians) that it is indeed rich in houses but full of
poverty and idleness,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> and of Ragha that it is indeed
Zoroastian but full of utter unbelief<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>&mdash;if the sin of

clear that these lands are distinct from the region in
which the pure doctrine of Zarathrustra, proclaimed in
the Avesta, arose, and became so firmly established as
to be universally current. Hence of all the lands in
Iran, mentioned in the Avesta, only Airyana Vaeja,
Margiana, Sogdiana, and Bactria remain.  In the
Avesta Zarathrustra is famous in Airyana Vaeja; in
that land he sacrifices; and, as the Avesta allots but
two months of summer and ten months of cold winter
to this region, we must look for it on the high mountain
range of the North-east (p. 73). Zarathrustra stands
in a close relation to Queen Hutao&ccedil;a and King Vista&ccedil;pa,
who fights against the worshippers of the
Daevas and Arejata&ccedil;pa, and prepares a way for the
new doctrine. Among the heroes of the ancient time
and the spirits of the pious who are invoked in the
prayers of the Avesta, the immortal part of King
Vista&ccedil;pa is repeatedly invoked besides Zarathrustra
and Frashaostra. We have already shown in what a
contrast the Bactrians and Sogdiani stood to the
nations of the steppes of the Oxus, and what a position
is allotted to King Vista&ccedil;pa as repelling the
Iranians. In thus celebrating him as the protector
of Zarathrustra, the Avesta plainly puts Zarathrustra
himself in Bactria.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>If we may assume the fact that the reform of the
religion must have proceeded from Bactria and Sogdiana
in the north-east of Iran, the next question to
be decided is, whether it is possible to determine the
meaning and import of this reform. The forms and
views, which are found to agree in the Avesta and
Rigveda, we have already established, with complete
certainty, to be the ancient possession of the Arians of
Iran. The elements of the religious conception, and
several very definite forms and traits in the belief and
worship, were the same in the Panjab and Iran. The
leading principle was the contrast of the bright beneficent
powers who give life and increase and the evil
spirits of darkness, drought, and death. This possession
was therefore in existence before the reform. This
principle must have become more prominent among
the Arians of Iran owing to the nature of their
country. The fertile land and the desert were in far
greater proximity there than in the Panjab. The
centre of Iran was filled with a vast desert; wide and
barren table-lands spread out on north and south; the
most favoured regions were almost like oases. Closely
adjacent to the most fruitful valleys and slopes lay
endless steppes; blooming plains, shaded by thick
groups of trees, were surrounded by hot deserts of
sand. If the alpine districts of the north possessed
the most splendid forests and luxuriant pastures, yet
the snow fell early, and the winter was severe; if
vegetation ran riot on the fringe of the Caspian, fever
and reptiles infested the marshy plains. Close beside
abundant productiveness lay drought and desert, bare
flats of rock, deserts of sand, and fields of snow. The
inhabitants of Iran had not only to suffer from the
heat of summer but also from the cold of winter, from
the scorching winds of the desert as well as from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
snow-storms which came from the table-lands of the
north. On the one hand, pastures and fields were
covered for many weeks with snow; on the other, sand-storms
from the desert ruined the tillage; in one
district camels succumbed to the cold of the lofty
terraces, or slipped from the icy slopes down the
precipices; in another, the desert wind dried up fountains
and springs. Here the winter, "which flies past
to slay the herds, and is full of snow," as the Avesta
says, was "of endless duration;" it was "on the water,
the trees, and the field," and "its cold penetrated to
the heart of the earth;" there the herds were tormented
by the fly in the heat, bears and wolves fell
upon the folds, and it was necessary to find protection
against serpents and ravenous beasts of prey.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> In this
land life was a conflict against the heat of summer and
the south, against the chill of winter and the mountain
heights, a struggle for the maintenance and protection
of the herds; and as soon as these tribes had
become settled in the more favoured regions and
passed over to agriculture, there began on the edge of
those oases the struggle against the desert and the
steppe. Here water must be conveyed to the dry
earth, there the tillage must be protected against the
sand-storms of the desert. To these difficulties and contrasts
in the nature of the land was added a contrast in
the mode of life of the population. The majority of
the tribes of the table-land of the interior, and a part
of the inhabitants of the mountainous rim, could not,
owing to the nature of the land, pass beyond a nomadic
pastoral life, and even to this day the population of Iran
is to a considerable extent nomadic;<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> while other tribes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
toiled laboriously in the sweat of their brows, these
wandered with their herds in idleness, ever ready for
battle; and thus there could be no lack of ambuscades
and plunder, of attacks and raids on the cultivated
districts.</p>

<p>All these contrasts are most marked on the slopes
of the north-eastern edge, in Margiana, Bactria, and
Sogdiana, which lay open to the steppes of the Caspian
Sea. Here were fruitful, blooming valleys with luxuriant
vegetation on the banks of the mountain streams,
yet, wherever the mountains receded, the endless desert
at once began. If the stars shone clear through the
night on mountains and table-lands, in the pure and
vapourless atmosphere of Iran, sand-storms and mist
lay on the northern desert. The winds blowing from
the north brought icy cold in the winter; in the
summer they drove the sand of the deserts over the
fruitful fields, to which water has to be laboriously
conveyed in the time of the greatest heat, while
eternal winter reigned in the heights of Belurdagh
and Hindu Kush. There was also the continual fear
of the nomads who dwelt on the steppes to the north,
who made attacks on the fruitful slopes and valleys.
We have already shown that it was precisely on the
slopes of the Hindu Kush that the necessity of protection
against the nations of the steppes led to a
combination of the forces of the tribes who were settled
there, and gave the impulse to the formation of a
larger polity.</p>

<p>In such a territory, when the tribes had once become
settled in the more favoured regions, amid such struggles
against nature and the plundering neighbours,
it is clear that the conception of the contrast between
good and evil spirits must become more widely developed
and sharply pointed&mdash;that it should indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
form the hinge of all religious ideas. The good spirits
had given fruit and increase to many excellent lands;
but the evil spirits destroyed these blessings with their
storms of sand and snow, their cold and heat, their
beasts of prey and serpents. Wherever the herds
throve and the fields were fruitful, there the good
spirits were gracious; where the pastures withered,
and the fields were covered with sand, the wicked
spirits had maliciously rendered of no avail the labours
of men. In the valleys of Bactria and Sogdiana there
was labour, industry, increase and fruit; beyond, in
the steppe, all was barren; the storms went whirling
round, and wild hordes of robbers roamed to and fro.
Thus in these regions the conception of the struggle of
the good spirits, and the evil, which injure, torment,
punish and murder men, was most lively, the religious
feeling of these conceptions most completely penetrated
and governed the minds of men.</p>

<p>All creatures were oppressed by the evil spirits, so
the Avesta told us (p. 129); and therefore Auramazda
determines to teach Zarathrustra "the wise sayings."
No new belief or new forms of worship are to be
introduced; the means of protection against the evil
ones were to be multiplied and strengthened. We
know what importance the Arians in India ascribed to
the correct prayer and invocation, what power over
the spirits and indeed over the deities themselves they
ascribed to the correct words, what a defensive power
they attributed to the sayings of the Atharvan. The
same ideas were current among the Arians of Iran.
The heaven of the good god and holy spirits is, in the
Avesta, the "dwelling of invocations" (Garonmana).
Hence the first point in the reform was that new
formul&aelig; and prayers should be added to the old
prayers and incantations. The fire that slays demons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
is to burn day and night on the hearth, and must
always be tended with hard, dry, well-hewn wood;
the spirits of light, the great Mithra, the sun, the stars,
are to be earnestly invoked along with the victorious
Verethraghna, and &Ccedil;raosha the slayer of demons, the
life-giving god, to whom Haoma is to be offered; and
the libation of Haoma is to be frequently offered to the
spirits of light. If men prayed constantly to the good
spirits, and cursed the evil, if they made use of the holy
sayings when they observed that the evil beings came,
then wicked creatures would certainly remain far from
house, and farm, and field. According to the Avesta,
Zarathrustra first uttered the Ahuna vairya, and Angromainyu
says that though the deities have not been
able to drive him from the earth, Zarathrustra will
smite him with the Ahuna vairya.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> In the minds of
the priests of the Avesta, this prayer is itself a mighty
being to which worship is to be offered, just as in the
Vedas the holy prayers and some parts of the ritual&mdash;nay
even the verse-measure of the hymns&mdash;are treated
as divine powers.</p>

<p>It was an old Arian conception, which we have
observed widely spread on the Ganges, that filth and
pollution and contact with what is impure and dead
gave the evil spirit power over those who had contracted
such defilement. This uncleanness must be
removed, and its operation checked. The reform,
which bears the name of Zarathrustra, must have
extended and increased in Iran the rules for purification
and the removal of uncleanness. These regulations,
carried out in long and wearisome detail on
the basis of this new movement, are before us in the
Vendidad. The Avesta says: Zarathrustra was the
first who praised the Asha Vahista (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the best truth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>fulness
which is at the same time the highest purity)
and represents Angromainyu as exclaiming; "that
Zarathrustra made him as hot by the Ashi Vahista as
metal is made in the melting."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>Whatever gave increase and life, water and trees
and good soil, and the animals which were useful to
men, were the work of the good spirits, the good
creation; the steppes, the desert, the heat, the fierce
cold, the beasts of prey, these were the work of the
evil ones, the bad creation. Did not a man increase
life and growth if he industriously cultivated his field,
watered it well, and extended it towards the desert, if
he destroyed the animals and insects which did harm
to the fields and trees, if he gave room to fruitfulness
against unfertility? Did he not extend and sustain
the good creation, and lessen the evil, if he planted and
watered, and diminished the harmful animals, the
serpents, the worms, and beasts of prey? By such
work a man took the side of the good spirits against
the evil, and fought with them. It was in the will
and power of man by the act of his hands, by labour
and effort, to strengthen the good creation. The
importance which the Avesta ascribes to the cultivation
of the land, we may regard as a prominent trait of the
reform, as an essential part of its ethical importance.
Beside warriors and priests the Avesta knows only
the agricultural class.</p>

<p>In the Veda the gods of the light and the highest
heaven, Mithra and Varuna, are the guardians of truth
and purity, the avengers and punishers of evil deeds.
The invocation of Mithra in the Avesta, given above,
showed us that the Arians of Iran recognised in this
deity the spirit of purity, the inevitable avenger of
injustice. With his all-penetrating eye he watches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
not only over purity of body, but also over purity
of soul. We may regard it as certain that the reform
carried a long step forward the ethical impulse
which lay in this conception of Mithra&mdash;a conception
current on both sides of the Indus. This view is
supported by the great importance which the Avesta
ascribes to truthfulness, in the decisive value given
to this virtue for the purity of the soul, and the
identification of purity with truthfulness. As filth
defiles the body, so, according to the Avesta, does a lie
defile the soul. Lying and deception are the worst
sins of which a man can be guilty. The ethical
advance is obvious when the evil spirits are not merely
regarded as doing harm to men, but it is emphatically
stated that they deceive men, and a lie is the essence
of the evil spirits. In the Avesta a part of them have
simply the name of the spirits of deception, of the
Druj. The suppliants of the true gods are called
<i>Ashavan, i.&nbsp;e.</i> the true, the pure; the worshippers of
the evil spirits are liars.</p>

<p>The ideas of the Veda about the hosts of the spirits
of ancestors, and the entrance of the good and pious
into the heaven of light, are also current among the
Arians of Iran. These the reform could not leave
untouched. From the ethical characteristic which
marks them, from the severe inculcation of a pure, true,
active life, it proceeded to the idea of a sort of judgment
on the souls after death. The detailed form in
which this idea is presented to us in the Avesta will
be given below.</p>

<p>In all religions, when they have reached a certain
stage of development, the impulse arises to find the
unity of the divine being among the multifarious crowd
of deities. On the Ganges the Brahmans or priests
attained to this unity by elevating the power of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
holy acts which controlled the deities, and was mightier
than they, into the lord of the gods, by uniting with
this conception the great breath or world-soul, the
source of life springing up in nature. In Iran the
reform did not look on nature as one, like the Brahmans
on the Ganges, and owing to the character of
the land and the strong contrasts there met with it
could not easily perceive in it any single whole; on
the contrary, it comprehended in unity, on the one
hand, the good beneficent side of nature, which gives
increase, light, and life to men; and, on the other,
ranged the harmful powers together in opposition to
the good. Hence it came about that the spirits which
worked on either side were, so to speak, combined,
and the two totals came forward in opposition. To
these totals the reform sought to give unity by placing
a chieftain at the head of each, the good and the bad.
The chief of the good was Ahura, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the lord, who
is also denoted by the name Mazda, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the wise, but
he is generally invoked by the united title Ahura
Mazda (Auramazda in the dialect of Western Iran),
the wise lord; occasionally, in the Avesta, he is called
&Ccedil;pentomainyu, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the spirit of holy mind, the holy
spirit. In the Rigveda the name Ahura Mazda, in the
form Asura Medha, is used for more than one god of
light. The chief of the evil spirits was Angromainyu,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> he that thinks evil, the destroying spirit.</p>

<p>The good and the evil spirits are regarded as active,
the one on the beneficent, the other on the injurious
side of nature. It was a step in advance when the
reform arrived at the conception, that as the good
and evil spirits ruled the life of nature and man,
so in the beginning of the world, at the time of
its origin, the good and evil spirits must have been
active; the good was from the beginning the work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
of the good; the evil the work of the evil. As
the heavenly and infernal spirits were regarded as
in perpetual activity, the reform could not here, as in
India, look on nature and men as emanations from a
being in repose&mdash;from the world-soul&mdash;the nature of
which became ever less pure and bright, less really
itself, as the emanations advanced. Instead of an
emanation, the active force and contrast of the spirits
gave rise to the idea that the world was brought into
being by the will and power of the two supreme spirits
to a creation of the world. The good side of the
world must have been the work of the chief of the good
spirits, the evil side the work of the evil. Auramazda
created the good, but immediately he created
it, Angromainyu created the evil in order to destroy
the good. And as at the creation, so also in the
created world, the mutual opposition of the good and
evil god, the struggle of their hosts, goes on. There
is no direct contest between Auramazda and Angromainyu;
they operate against each other for increase
and destruction, life and death, and for the souls of
men; the direct conflict against evil remains, even
after the reform, with the old spirits, with Mithra,
Verethragna, &Ccedil;raosha, and Tistrya.</p>

<p>From this we may without hesitation draw the
inference that Auramazda and Angromainyu did not
belong to the original belief of the Arians of Iran.
From the absence of any myth about Auramazda, and
the character of the names, "the wise lord," "the
destroying spirit," it further follows that the gods
thus named could not be the creation of any primitive
religious feeling. These names belong to a period of
reflection, which strives to make a presentment of the
general operation of the good and evil powers, of
their intellectual and ethical characteristics, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the same time seeks to express their nature, as well
as their relation to the world. Finally, the wavering
position which Auramazda takes up in the Avesta
towards the old deities, shows that he is of later
origin. Though now the supreme deity, he sacrifices
to Tistrya, in order to give him strength for the victory
over Apaosha (p. 120); to Ardvi&ccedil;ura, that Zarathrustra
may be obedient to him (p. 129); and to other
gods of the old period. Beside him Mithra is praised
in the old style as the highest power; he instructs
Zarathrustra to invoke the old gods, who still continue
in their traditionary activity. But we have express
evidence that Auramazda belongs to the reform.
"The first man," so the Avesta says, "who sacrificed
to Auramazda was the sacred Zarathrustra."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> In the
transformation, however loose, of the divine nature
into "the wise lord," with his change from a natural
force to an ethical and intellectual power, and elevation
to be the creator "of the heaven and the earth"
(p. 87), lay the most decisive step taken by the
reform; by these conceptions it had raised the ancient
possession of the Arians of Iran to a new stage.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the evil spirits in the
Avesta bear the name of Daevas. The Arians of India
called their good gods, the gods of light, Devas; from
the same root has sprung the general name of the gods
among the Greeks, Italians, and the Celts. Hence
among the Arians of Iran also it must once have been
in use for the spirits of light. Why the names Bagha
and Yazata became used in the Avesta for the good
gods, while the evil spirits received the name of Daevas
we cannot discover; nor can we decide whether this
change of name came in with the reform. We can
only discover that an analogous change has taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
place in India also. In the Rigveda the good gods
are comprised under the name Asura (old Bactrian
Ahura), <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the lord; at a later time the evil spirits
among the Indians were always called Asuras, while
in Iran the name is allotted to the highest among
the good spirits.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE DOCTRINE OF THE AVESTA.</h3>


<p>When the tribes of the Aryas advanced from the
Panjab towards the East, and established themselves on
the Ganges, the gods to whom they had offered prayers
on the Indus faded away amid the abundant fertility
of the new land; and the lively perception of the
struggle of the gods of light against the spirits of
darkness made room for the conception of the world-soul,
from which nature and all living creatures were
thought to have emanated. Similar religious principles
led the Arians in Iran to a religious reform of an
opposite kind. The idea of an emanation of the world,
proceeding without any opposition, could not maintain
itself in a life occupied in labour for the means of
sustenance, in toiling and struggling against nature.
Luxuriant growth and dreary desolation, scorching heat
and severe winter, such as were found alternating in
Iran, could not flow from one and the same source.
There man must be active and brave, and therefore
the divine being could not be regarded as existing in
repose. The nature of the table-land, divided between
fertile tillage and desert, between heat and cold, not
merely caused the old idea of the conflict between good
and evil spirits to continue, but even increased and
extended it. All nature was made subject to this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
opposing action of the gods, and the old conception of
the conflict was developed into a complete system.
With the extension of the operation of the beneficent
and harmful power over the whole of nature, man was
drawn into the conflict as active force. He must not
only invoke the assistance of the good spirits; he
must himself take part in the struggle of the good
against the evil. In this way he provided for his soul
and salvation better than by prayer and sacrifice; he
strengthened so far as in him lay the life and increase
of the world, and lessened the sphere in which the
power of the evil spirits could operate. If the Indians
by the elevation of Brahman arrived only at the great
contrast between nature and spirit, between soul and
body; if all nature was regarded as something evil and
to be annihilated, so that the mortification and torturing
of the body and annihilation of self became the
highest ethical aims&mdash;the Bactrians or Arians in Iran
were directed by their reform to more energetic work
and activity against the harmful side of nature, and
the evil part of the soul. With the free choice of this
or that side, with the duty of working on nature, and
educating self, the conditions of a more happy and
powerful development were given them.</p>

<p>It was the duty of any earnest and eminent adherents
of the reform, and afterwards of the priestly
races who joined it, or grew up in it, to guide the
impulse it had given, and bring the new ideas and the
rules to be deduced from them into harmony with the
old conceptions. If the contrast between the beneficent
and harmful powers once took the shape of opposing
spirits, the next object was to represent more exactly
the character and nature of these spirits, and define
more closely the good and evil Deity. As the reform
tended to elevate the natural side in these shapes into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
ethical qualities, it was inevitable that advance in this
direction should lead at an early time to abstract views&mdash;that
both spirits should be identified with the pure
contrast of light and darkness, of truth and lying, of
moral good and moral evil.</p>

<p>If the good spirit was supreme purity and truth, he
must originally have created the world in accordance
with his nature. Whence then came the injurious, the
evil? Had the evil spirit also a creative power? Or
was the evil first introduced after the creation of the
world? If this was the case, and evil was not always
in the world, then it must again disappear from it; if
the pure god was the more powerful, he must again
overcome the resistance of the evil. Moreover, with
the subordination of the light and dark powers to
Auramazda and Angromainyu, and their combination
into these two forms, an impulse was given which
gradually forced the ancient deities into the background.
The first point was, to put the latter in the
right relation to the new god, who had created heaven
and earth, and even these ancient gods. In the same
way the old Arian legend of the golden age of Yima
must be harmonised with the new doctrine of the
creation, and a relation must be established between
the sacrificers of the old days, who were without the
good law of Zarathrustra, and the latter. The sayings
which held in check the evil spirits, and which the
reform took from the body of ancient invocations or
added to them in their spirit, must be accurately preserved
if they were not to lose their force, especially the
prayers and incantations which Zarathrustra himself
had spoken or was thought to have spoken. Lastly,
the mode of worship must be regulated in accordance
with the tendencies of the reform. Which and what
kind of sacrifices, which invocations and songs of praise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
were the most efficacious, was a matter which required
settling. The old customs of purification so indispensable
for keeping at a distance the evil spirits, which
the reform, as we ventured to assume, largely increased
by new prescripts, must be united with the increased
importance attached to truth and purity and combined
into a comprehensive rule for the life pleasing to
Auramazda. What means were there for wiping out
offences against this rule, and sins when committed,
for turning aside the anger of Mithra, for expiating
falsehood, lying, and deception? We have already
indicated (p. 101) how numerous and complicated
were the duties of the priesthood arising out of
pollution and its removal. The answers which the
priesthood of Iran gave to all the questions which
successively arose have been collected in the Avesta.</p>

<p>The Gathas of the Avesta, in which the metre has
been retained, and along with it the older forms of the
language&mdash;poems which, according to another part of
the Avesta (the &Ccedil;rosh Yasht), Zarathrustra composed
and &Ccedil;raosha first sang<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>&mdash;are the most speculative
part of the book. They tell of the existence of the
good and evil spirits, place both in the beginning of
things, identify Auramazda with the truth and Angromainyu
with the lie, bring forward Auramazda as the
creator of the world and of living creatures, as the
source of what is good in man and nature, and describe
the duties of the true worshippers and the rewards
which they may expect, together with the punishments
which will come upon the worshippers of the
Daevas. The ancient gods, Mithra, Haoma, Tistrya,
Anahita and Drva&ccedil;pa are not mentioned in the
Gathas; though emphasis is laid on the blessing of
the "imperishable red fire of Auramazda." In their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
place we have Asha (Truthfulness), and Vohumano
(Good disposition), Armaiti (Piety), and Kshathra
(Dominion); these are at times merely ideas, at times
they are personified beside Auramazda.</p>

<p>In these poems Zarathrustra addresses a number of
questions to Auramazda: "This question I will ask of
thee; answer it truly, O Ahura. Who is the first
father and begetter of truth? Who created their
paths for the sun and stars? Who causes the moon
to wax and wane? Who sustains the earth and holds
the clouds above it? Who created the water and
the trees of the field? Who is in the wind and the
storms that they move so swiftly? Who created the
beneficent lights and the darkness? For whom didst
thou create the imperishable cow Ranyo&ccedil;kereti (the
Earth)? Who formed the earth with its great blessings?
Who are the Daevas, which fight against the
good creation? Who slew the hostile demons? Who
is the truthful one, who is the liar? How are we to
chase away the lies, how shall I put the lies into the
hand of Asha (Truthfulness)? How can I come to your
dwelling (the dwelling of the gods), and to your song?
Give me now the command, what ought to be and
what ought not to be, in such a way that we attentive
ones may understand it, O Mazda, with the tongue of
thy mouth, how am I to convert all living creatures,
and guide them to the right path, which leads to him
who hears the praises of the truly pious in heaven
(Garonmana). Tell me clearly, what ye command me
as the best, that I may keep it in my heart, and
remember what has been forgotten, Mazda Ahura, all
that ought to be, and ought not to be. Teach us, O
True one, the way of Vohumano created by thee.
Let us, O Mazda, receive thy sayings which bring
blessing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>"On thee have I looked as the source in the
creation of life, because thou, O rich in gifts, didst
establish the sacred customs and announce the words.
He who first willed that the spaces of the sky should
clothe themselves with lights, he in his wisdom establishes
the law of duty for the pious. In the spirit a
man must think of thee that thou art ever the same,
Ahura. I regarded thee as the most excellent, O
Mazda, whom thy people have to worship in spirit, as
the father of the pious, since I saw thee with my eye,
as the eternal law-giver of the world, living in his
works. Since thou of old, O Mazda, didst create all
beings and spirits according to thy will, and gave
them reason and a material body, all men, the wise
and the unwise, cause their voices to sound, each
according to his heart and mind; he who strives after
wisdom proves in his spirit on which side is error.
All gleaming bodies with their manifestations, everything
that by Vohumano has a bright eye, the stars
and the sun, the herald of the day, move for thy
praise, O Mazda. In thee the holy earth exists, and
the highly-intelligent framer of the body of the earth,
O living spirit Mazda. Thou didst create the world,
the earth with the fire that rests in its bosom. With
pleasant fields thou didst adorn it, after taking counsel
with Vohumano, O Mazda. Thou didst first create
the fields, and didst devise the sayings by thy spirit,
and the various kinds of knowledge; thou didst then
create this world of existence, by holy acts and speeches.
To Mazda belongs this kingdom which he causes to
grow by his grace."<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>"To you, all ye that come, I will announce the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
praises of Mazda the all-wise lord, and the hymns to
Vohumano. O wise Asha, I will entreat that friendship
may display itself through the stars. Hear with your
ears the glorious, see with your spirit the clear, that
every one for himself may choose his faith before the
great work begins. Those two prim&aelig;val spirits, which
are twins, represent themselves in thought, words, and
works as this dualism, the good and the evil, and
between both the virtuous know how to decide, but
not the evil. When these two deities first came
together, they created the good creatures and the bad,
and (arranged) that at the last hell should be awarded
to the bad and blessedness to the good. Of these two
spirits the evil one chooses the worst way of action;
but the increase-giving spirit chooses virtue, he whose
robe is the firm heaven,&mdash;and those who in faith make
Auramazda content by truthful acts. Between them
the worshippers of the Daevas, the deceived, cannot
rightly decide; they chose the worst disposition, and
came to the evil ones when in council, and together
they hastened to Aeshma, that by him they might
bring plagues upon the life of men. But when the
punishment of their evil deeds shall be accomplished,
and thy kingdom as the reward of piety shall come
upon those who put the Druj (the lie) in the hands of
Asha (Truthfulness), then destruction overtake the
destroying Druj; but those who possess high renown
will gather as immortal in the beautiful dwellings of
Vohumano, of Mazda, and Asha. Thus then let us
work to make this world eternal, O Auramazda, O
Asha that givest blessing; may our thoughts be there,
where wisdom is enthroned."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>These are the essential traits of the doctrine of the
Gathas. Auramazda, himself a shining one (<i>hvathra</i>),
has created the shining bodies of the heaven, the earth,
the waters, the trees, and men; he has appointed their
paths for the stars. He is the sustainer of the world,
inasmuch as he devises the good sayings (<i>daena</i>) for
the protection of the good creation. He is light and
truth, and therefore is not to be deceived; he shows
the right way to Zarathrustra, and gives him the
proper charms against the evil spirits. That at this
stage of ideas there can be no myth attached to
Auramazda, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to the concentrated essence of the
gods of light, is obvious. In the Gathas it is only the
quite abstract forces of Vohumano and Asha, of good
disposition and truthfulness, which stand beside him.
Auramazda is simply the creator and lord; and the
same position is ascribed to him as we saw (p. 87) in
the inscriptions of the Ach&aelig;menids. In spite of the
strongly-marked trait of spiritualisation and abstraction
which runs through the Gathas, there is no lack
in them of unreflecting and na&iuml;ve conceptions, which
have come down to us from ancient days. It is true
that the contrasts in nature and men are elevated to
the opposition of truth and falsehood, and the service
of truth is proclaimed as the highest command; but
on the other hand, it is the strong fire of Auramazda
which causes the right to be recognised, and gives
the decision in battle.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> It is the good sayings which
sustain the world, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the old magic of prayers and
invocations is to keep off the evil, and increase the
strength of the good, spirits. However high may be
the conception of Auramazda, he who walks in his
way, and performs the commands of purity, not only
expects his reward, but insists on it; he desires to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
obtain ten mares and stallions, and at least one camel;
he wishes for the blessings of Haurvatat in order to
sacrifice from them; he desires continuance and power,
health and long life. In these traits the old contrast
between powers that give increase, blessing, and
life, and powers of destruction, is plainly retained.</p>

<p>From the beginning the evil one was ranged over
against Auramazda as his twin brother. He has
created all that is evil, but nevertheless he is without
any independent power of creation. If the Gathas
express this merely in such a manner that they give
prominence to Auramazda as the creator, they were as
far from setting up a dualism of equally-balanced
forces, as any other religion has been from attempting
such a task, and carrying it out. The other fragments
of the Avesta leave no doubt of the fact, that Angromainyu
was not in a position to create the world
according to his own will; he can only implant the
form of evil in the good creation of Auramazda; he
puts desolation, destruction, and death in the place of
increase. The Vendidad quotes a whole series of
lands which Auramazda created good, and enumerates
the evils which the deadly Angromainyu brought into
each:&mdash;into one winter, into another excessive heat;
in one case vermin, in another disease, in a third
beasts of prey. In the same way, in opposition to
moral good, the evil one creates idleness, lies, lust,
doubt, disbelief. An equally poised power of the two
deities would have led to a direct conflict between
them, which occurs nowhere in the Avesta; God and
the devil only contend for the increase and injury of
the world, and for the souls of men. The relative
inferiority of the evil deity has not escaped the Greeks.
"Some are of opinion," Plutarch says, "that there are
two opposite deities, one of which framed the good,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the other the evil. Others, however, name the better
power the god, the other the demon, as Zoroaster
the Magian. He calls one Oromazdes, the other Areimanius,
and states that Oromazdes most resembles
light among perceptible things, and Areimanius gloom
and uncertainty."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> It is a later speculation, diverging
from the Avesta, which formed the good and evil
spirits into simple forces, and ranged them against
each other with equal powers.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Gathas we have the nucleus of the conceptions
from which the reform of the ancient faith of
Iran arose, but not in their original state. On the
contrary, they have been systematised in the circles
of the priests. Hence the contents and prescripts of
other parts of the Avesta, which do not present a
speculative tendency, are not on that account to be
regarded as of later origin than the Gathas&mdash;least of
all the invocations to the ancient deities. It was an
essential object of priestly meditation to bring these
old gods, which existed vividly before the soul of the
nation, into harmony with the new faith. On every
page of the Avesta it is clear that the priests of Eastern
Iran did not attain to an accepted system in this
direction; that the old gods remained in existence
beside Auramazda, and the direct contest against the
evil spirits, after the reform as before it, was carried
on by Mithra, Verethraghna, and Vayu, Tistrya and
&Ccedil;raosha, while Auramazda is in the background, and
sits somewhat passively on his golden throne in the
heaven of Garonmana. When the Avesta was written
down and collected, the ideas of the priests were still
so na&iuml;ve, or still preserved such a respect for the
traditional forms of the gods of light and water, as
they obviously lived in the mind of the people, that
they represent Auramazda himself as offering sacrifice
to Mithra,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Anahita, Vayu, and Tistrya, with Haoma
and the sacred bundle of twigs, in order to strengthen
their power or carry out his own wishes, just as the
gods of the Aryas in India offer sacrifices to one
another. In India the old gods received a subordinate
position as protectors of the world after the rise of
Brahman, but in Iran this was not the case; nor were
they brought into any genealogical connection with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
their new head Auramazda, though fire is occasionally
spoken of in a figure as the son of Auramazda, and the
earth (Armaiti) is once or twice called his daughter.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
The only bond of union between the new god and the
old gods in the Avesta is the fact that Auramazda is
made the creator of the old gods, and even of Mithra.
Yet the old position of Mithra appears, when Auramazda
says to Zarathrustra: "When I created Mithra,
the lord of wide pastures, I created him as mighty to
pray to, mighty to worship as myself." Tistrya also
was created by Auramazda as worthy of adoration and
praise as himself.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> We are already acquainted with
Auramazda's command to Zarathrustra to invoke and
worship Mithra, Vayu, the other ancient gods, and
fire (p. 131). The existence and extent of this worship
is proved not only by the prayers of the Ya&ccedil;na, but
also by the accounts of western writers which we have
already examined.</p>

<p>As a compensation for the independent life of the
ancient gods by the side of Auramazda, the priests
surrounded his throne with six spirits, who were his
associates and helpers. These are called Amesha
&Ccedil;pentas, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the holy immortals; as good and wise
kings they rule with Auramazda over the seven girdles
of the earth,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> as in India the eight protectors of the
world rule over the eight zones. The views out of
which these spirits arose are found in the Gathas, but
they did not receive their complete form till the
Gathas had been composed and generally received.
Plutarch tells us that, according to the faith of the Persians,
Oromazdes had created six gods: the first, the
god of good disposition (&#949;&#8020;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;);
the second, the god<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of truth (&#7936;&#955;&#942;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;);
the third, the god of order and law
(&#949;&#8016;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#945;); the three remaining deities were the gods of
wisdom (&#963;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;), of wealth (&#960;&#955;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;&#962;),
and of delight in the beautiful
(&#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#1008;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7969;&#948;&#941;&#969;&#957;).
The two first, good disposition (Vohumano), and truth or truthfulness,
we already found frequently mentioned in the Gathas,
but chiefly as ideas rather than persons. With the
priests Vohumano and Asha vahista (the most excellent
truthfulness) became the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas, who
stand next to Auramazda. The Avesta speaks not
only of the good way of Vohumano, but also of
his acts, his dwelling, and his kingdom. According
to the books of the Parsees it is his duty to protect
the flocks. Asha vahista, as the truthful one, is the
protector of fire, which points the right path, and,
according to the Gathas, gives the decision in the
contest against the liars. According to the books of
the Parsees, Asha builds the bridge of Chinvat, to
which the souls come after death, making it wide
when the pious souls step upon it. Not less correctly
does Plutarch describe the third Amesha &Ccedil;penta as
the spirit of order and law. Kshathra, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the kingdom,
the dominion, is mentioned impersonally in the
Gathas; and this idea the priests have elevated into
Kshathra vairya, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the good spirit of the desired
dominion, of good order and law, which is the third
Amesha &Ccedil;penta. Metals were allotted to him as the
king of the Ameshas.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> The fourth figure in this circle,
which Plutarch correctly describes as the spirit of
wisdom, though he is wrong in calling it a god, is the
earth spirit Armaiti. In the Rigveda Aramati (the
earth) is a maiden worthy of praise, who, morning
and evening, brings butter to Agni. In the Avesta
Armaiti is "the beautiful daughter of Auramazda, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
bearer (<i>barethri</i>) of cattle, of beasts of draught, and
men;" with "her hands Auramazda performs pure
actions," while the Gathas also ascribe to her special
relations to the corporeal world.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Among the priests
the spirit of the "patient humble earth" has become
the spirit of humility and piety. According to the
books of the Parsees Armaiti gives patience and firmness.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
The fifth and sixth spirits also, whom Plutarch
calls the gods of wealth and delight in the beautiful,
were found in existence by the priests, and merely
ranged by them in the circle of the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas.
These are Haurvatat and Ameretat. We saw how
earnestly the Arians of India besought the gods for
wealth and length of life; and in this matter the
Arians of Iran were not behind them. Here, as
there, the powers which could grant such gifts were
elevated into special spirits, to whom, naturally, all
that gave wealth and long life, good and healing
plants and refreshing water, belonged. The good
plants were the kingdom of Ameretat, refreshing water
the domain of Haurvatat. In the fancy of the Arians
of Iran good plants sprang from the tree of heaven,
the Gaokerena, which grew in Ardvi&ccedil;ura (p. 126); the
water flowed down from this source in heaven, or came
from Vourukasha, the lake on the divine mountain.
Those two spirits, who ruled over plants and water,
were brought by the system of the priests into the
circle of the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas; the province over which
they ruled had long been apportioned to them. They
were distinguished from the first four by the fact that
those were personifications of moral ideas, these two
were personifications of real goods.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> With wealth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
prosperity and happy life is given, with length of
life the complete enjoyment of its blessings, and so
the Greeks could arrive at the conclusion that these
two spirits were gods of wealth and delight in
beauty. Thus Auramazda now ruled surrounded by
six sacred forms. The semblance of this circle on
earth was the throne of Cyrus and his successors,
which was surrounded by the six tribal princes of
the Persians.</p>

<p>The personification of ideas&mdash;the process of transforming
old figures, and changing them into abstractions&mdash;did
not come to an end with the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas.
We are acquainted with &Ccedil;raosha, the warrior against
the Daevas, his habitation on the divine mountain, his
horses, his club, and how he fights at the side of
Mithra, and keeps watch in the dark of the night
against the demons (p. 121). Now it is he who first
sang the sacred four Gathas of Zarathrustra, who first
bound the sacred withes, "three twigs, five twigs,
seven twigs;" he not only knows the sacred word;
the sacred word is the body of &Ccedil;raosha. Instead of
the club which he held raised against the head of the
Daevas, the invocations of the Avesta and the prayer
Ahuna vairya are now the weapons with which he,
"the pure lord of the pure," "advances the world."
We remember the process by which the Arians in
India came to represent Indra as smiting Vritra, and
shattering his cave, not as formerly with the lightning,
but with Brahman, the power of the prayer and the
sacred acts. Obviously we have some influence of
these old Arian conceptions of the mysterious power
of prayer, and the control of the spirits possessed by
the correct invocations and sayings against gods and
spectres, when we find &Ccedil;raosha fighting with the
prayers of the Avesta, and in the Avesta the sacred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
word is praised as a Divine power&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> when Zarathrustra
offers sacrifice to the good law.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> More liberal creations
on the part of the system of the priests are the
elevation of "excellent thought, knowledge, and conception,"
of "the long study," "and the thought of
the pure man," which are invoked and praised in the
Avesta, into Divine powers. Of not less abstract
nature are other forms, like Rashnu razista, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
most straight-forward justice,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> which, according to the
Dinkart, tests the souls on the bridge of Chinvat; time,
which is invoked as unlimited, as the ruler of the long
periods, and like the genius of the five portions into
which the priests divided the day. Of older origin,
though also modified by the reform, is the invocation
of the heights, which Mithra first illuminated with his
light. In the Avesta this invocation is mainly addressed
to the high "navel of the waters," the Divine
mountain, which reaches to the sky, "on which were
asked the holy questions," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> on which Zarathrustra
has received the revelation; "by reason of the revelation
of the sacred word we invoke the height, which
preserved the knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Many of the traditional
forms of ancient times were partly modified by the
priests and partly allowed to fade away. The goddess
Drva&ccedil;pa, to whom the ancient heroes had sacrificed,
they changed into the soul of the primeval bull, which
Angromainyu had slain.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Nairyo&ccedil;angha, the Nara&ccedil;ansa
of the Veda, an ancient name of the spirit of
fire, which we learned to know in the Veda as the
messenger of men to the heavenly beings, as priest
and mediator between heaven and earth (IV. 39), appears
in the Avesta merely as the messenger of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
gods.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> The form of Vayu, the more ancient conception
of which still plainly breaks through (p. 116), becomes
merely the air "whose operation is on high;" and
Ashi vanguhi, whom the ancient sacrificers and heroes
invoked, together with Ardvi&ccedil;ura, for victory, bears
traces which can hardly any longer be recognised.
We merely perceive that she could once confer
power, fertility, beauty, and wealth. We saw above
how she called Zarathrustra to her chariot, and promised
splendour to his body, and long prosperity
to his soul (p. 130). If the luminaries of heaven,
in spite of the creation described to Auramazda, are
extolled as "having no beginning," we have in this
fact a glimpse of the old position of the spirits of light.
The struggles of Tistrya against the demons of
drought were allowed to remain (p. 120). Plutarch
observes that, according to the doctrine of the Magians,
Oromazdes had placed Sirius (Tistrya) as a watchman
and advanced guard. On the other hand, the worship
of the sun-god appears but faintly in the Avesta&mdash;in
our fragments at any rate. Yet Herodotus informs us
that with the Persians the neighing of horses at sunrise
was regarded as a favourable sign from the gods,
and Xenophon states that the Magians offered bulls
to Zeus, but horses to the sun-god, and that on the
journeys of the Ach&aelig;menids the chariot of Zeus went
first, then that of the sun-god; both were white and
crowned; and these were followed by a third chariot
covered with purple, which as it seems was the chariot
of fire. In the march of Xerxes to Hellas, according
to the account of Herodotus, a sacred car, yoked with
eight white horses, went before him; and ten sacred
horses were led, clothed in the most beautiful trappings.
Curtius represents the emblem of the sun as glowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
over the tent of the last Darius, who invokes "the sun,
Mithra, and the sacred eternal fire;" and he tells us
of the chariot of Zeus in the army, yoked with white
horses, behind which was led a horse of remarkable
size, the horse of the sun, with golden bridle and
white covering, like those before the chariot. Dio
Chrysostom tells us that the Magians reared a yoke
of Nisaean horses for Zeus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> for Mithra, which were
the largest and most beautiful in all Asia, and a horse
for Helius.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> We can call to mind the battle-chariot
of Mithra, "with golden wheels and silver spokes"
(p. 110). These were imitations of the divine chariots
of which the Greeks tell us, and if they were not in
a position to distinguish accurately what belonged to
Mithra (Auramazda does not come into the question),
and what to Hvare Kshaeta (the sun-god)&mdash;Strabo is
of opinion that the Persians called the sun Mithras<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>&mdash;we
may still conclude with certainty from these
statements, that the worship of Mithra and the sun-god
remained more vigorous and effectual among the
princes and nations of Iran than our fragments of the
Avesta would allow us to assume, if the old invocations
to Mithra, Tistrya, Haoma, Vayu, and Verethraghna
had not been preserved in them. Yet the fragments
do present us with an invocation to the sun-god,
though weakened, it is true, and adapted to the new
faith.  "We celebrate the brilliant, immortal sun,
whose horses are unwearied. When the sun gleams
in heaven, the heavenly spirits come by hundreds and
thousands, and spread the light over the earth for the
salvation of the pure world, for the salvation of the
pure bodies.  As the sun rises, the earth purifies
herself, and the fructifying waters of the springs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
pools and lakes; the sun-god purifies all creatures
that belong to &Ccedil;pentomainyu. If the sun came not,
the Daevas would slay all that inhabits the seven
girdles of the earth, and the heavenly beings would
not be able to withstand them; they could not drive
them away. He who sacrifices to the sun in order to
withstand the dark Daevas, the thieves and robbers,
he sacrifices to Auramazda, to the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas
and to his own soul."<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> In the time of the Sassanids,
the worship of the sun comes definitely forward.</p>

<p>Plutarch states that the demon Areimanius had
created an equal number of evil spirits to match the
six good gods of Oromazdes, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas.
The Vendidad mentions five of them: Andra, &Ccedil;aurva,
Naonghaithya, Tauru, and Zairicha,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> to which we have
only to add Akomano, which has been mentioned
already in the Gathas, in order to make up the number.
They are all of them creations of the priests, partly
invented to match the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas, partly borrowed
from older forms, which had lost their brightness among
the Arians of Iran. Akomano, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Bad disposition,
is naturally the counterpart of Vohumano, or Good
disposition: opposite Asha vahista, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the most
excellent truthfulness, the priests placed the demon
Andra (Indra), <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> an old Arian name which the
Arians beyond the Indus had elevated to be the best
warrior against the demons, the god of the storm.
No special qualities of Andra are known or mentioned
in the Avesta; the books of the Parsees can only say
that he brings care and sorrow of heart to men, and
makes narrow the bridge of Chinvat. The demon
&Ccedil;aurva is the opponent of Kshathra vairya, of order
and law, of good dominion; hence, according to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Sad-der-Bundehesh, he leads kings astray into despotism,
and nations into lawlessness and robbery. Naonghaithya
is the opponent of Armaiti, the spirit of
humility and piety; this spirit therefore, as the Bundehesh
maintains, makes men impatient and proud;
the science of languages claims to find in this name
a Vedic name for the two A&ccedil;vins,&mdash;Nasatya (IV. 42).
Only the last two opposing spirits of the Amesha
&Ccedil;pentas, the opponents of Haurvatat and Ameretat,
display, like these beings, real characteristics. If they
are the spirits of water and plants, of prosperity and
long life or immortality, then Tauru is the spirit
of thirst and sickness, and Zairicha of hunger and
death.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>If the ancient gods have preserved more lively traits
than the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas, the old demons have also
more definite outlines than the opposing spirits. Such
are the Daeva Apaosha, who parches up the land and
keeps back the water from the earth; &Ccedil;penjaghra, the
comrade of him who was struck by lightning; Zemaka,
the spirit of the cold winter; and finally Azhi, who
seeks to steal away the fire from men in the night.
Among these evil spirits may further be reckoned a
female demon Bushyan&ccedil;ta, with long hands and of a
yellow hue, who leads men astray into much sleep and
idleness, who does not allow them to see the rise of
the sun, and shortens the joy of existence;<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> the three
Daevas of drunkenness, Kunda, Banga, and Vibanga;
the Daeva Buiti, the spirit of lies and falsehood, who
deceives men;<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> the spirit of flattery, Ashemaogha;<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> and
the very wicked Ashma "of evil glance," who attempts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
to slay the sleeping, and withstands &Ccedil;raosha by night
with terrible weapons.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> Very evil also is A&ccedil;tovidhotu,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the destroyer of bodies, and a female goblin, the
spirit of the Daevas, the Druj Na&ccedil;u. This spirit enters
the body immediately after death, and exercises power
over all who come in contact with it.</p>

<p>Under Auramazda are united the gods, the Amesha
&Ccedil;pentas, the rest of the Yazatas (those worthy of
adoration), in opposition to the troops of hell, the
Daevas, Druj, Pairikas and Jainis, which are led by
Angromainyu. The first are found in the light of
sunrise, in the clear gleam of the pure sky; the latter
in the gloom of sunset, or in the distant clouds of the
north; in burial-places, and where the dead are placed;
in all corners into which the light of heaven does not
pierce; in the dark abyss under earth; in "the worst
place."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> On the summit of the mountain Arezura
(Demavend, apparently), they take counsel how they
are to turn the evil eye on men; how they can injure
and slay them.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> To them belong gloom, cold, drought,
the barren land and the wilderness, thorns and
poisonous herbs, hunger and thirst, sickness, death,
dirt, laziness, lying, sin. Theirs are the harmful
beasts, the Khraf&ccedil;tras; beasts of prey, wolves, serpents;
all animals which live in holes and corners,
lizards, scorpions, toads, frogs, rats, mice, gnats, and
lastly mosquitoes, lice, and fleas.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> To the good spirits
belong light, water, springs, rivers, the fruitful earth,
good plants,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> trees, fields, pastures, good food, purity,
truth, life in this world and the next; and theirs are
the good animals, the animals of the flocks, the birds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
which nestle on the heights, and live in the clear air.
The dog and the cock are worshipped in the Avesta
as fighting with men against the Daevas. The first
protects the flocks against the beasts of prey of
Angromainyu. Of the cock the Avesta says: "The
bird Parodarsh, which evil-speaking men call Kahzkata&ccedil;
(<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Kikeriki or the like), lifts up his voice in the
last third of the night, roused by the holy &Ccedil;raosha
at every divine dawn. He cries: 'Rise up, ye men;
praise the most excellent truth; drive away the Daevas.'
Who gives a pair of these birds to a pure man, in
purity and kindness, gives as much as if he had given
a palace with a thousand pillars and a thousand
beams, ten thousand windows, and a hundred thousand
turrets." "And whoever gives to a pure man as
much meat as makes the size of a Parodarsh"&mdash;the
book of Auramazda tells us in another place&mdash;"I
who am Auramazda will ask him no other question
on his way to Paradise."<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> According to the Avesta
the dog and cock unite their powers against the
Druj.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The bird Asho-zusta fights against the
Daevas, and the bird Karshipta (the sacred hawk)
announces the good law in the garden of Yima.
Two other mythical birds, the two eagles (<i>&ccedil;aena</i>) of
the sky, Amru and Chamru, are invoked as helpful
powers.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> They nestle on the tree of life in the
heaven. Besides the tree Gaokerena, which grows
in Ardvi&ccedil;ura and bears the heavenly Haoma, the
Avesta has also the tree Vi&ccedil;pataokhma, which grows
in the Lake Vourukasha, and bears all seeds. When
Amru sits on this tree, the seeds fall down, and Chamru
carries them away where Tistrya collects the water,
who then rains down the seed with the water to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
earth. In the book of kings of Firdusi, Simurgh (&Ccedil;inmurv),
the king of the birds, carries Rustem on his
pinions over the broad earth as far as the sea of Chin
(China) to the tree of life.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> A prophet of the Hebrews

Xenophon tells us that Cyrus, and the Ach&aelig;menids
who succeeded him, carried as a standard a golden
eagle on a tall lance;<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and Curtius says, that a golden
eagle with outspread wings was attached to the
chariots of the Persian king.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>The fragments of the Avesta which have been preserved
do not give us very full information on the
sacrifices. The essential matters are hymns of praise
and prayers. The chief sacrifice is offered to one of
the old deities, Haoma, the supporter and protector of
life. When Plutarch represents the Magi as pounding
a certain herb of the name of Omomi in a mortar,
with invocations to avert Hades, he gives a correct
account of the supposed tendency of this sacrifice.
According to the Avesta the utensils for this sacrifice&mdash;the
mortar, cup and bundle of twigs&mdash;were found in
every house. The sacrifice consisted in the offering,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the elevation of the cup filled with the juice of
the Haoma, during the recitation of the proper prayers.
Beside this offering, which even now is offered twice
each day by the priests of the Parsees, the fire is to
be kept up perpetually, and fed with good dry wood
and perfumes. The flesh of the sacrifice (<i>myazda</i>) is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
not often mentioned; yet the book of the law provides
that a thousand head of small cattle must be offered
in expiation of certain offences,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and we are told in
the invocations that the heroes of old time, from
Thraetaona down to King Vista&ccedil;pa, had offered great
sacrifices of animals to Ardvi&ccedil;ura and Drva&ccedil;pa, in
order to gain the victory, viz. 100 horses, 1000
cattle, and 10,000 head of small cattle. Herodotus
tells us that the Magians, when Xerxes marched
into Hellas, sacrificed 1000 oxen on the summit of
Pergamus to Athene of Ilium, and at a later time
white horses in Thrace; Xenophon maintains that the
Persians sacrificed beautiful bulls to Zeus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to
Auramazda, and horses to the sun, and burnt them
whole; Athen&aelig;us tells that with the king of the
Persians a thousand animals were daily slaughtered
as sacrifices; camels, horses, oxen, apes, deer, and
especially sheep. According to Arrian, the Magians
who kept guard over the burial-place of Cyrus received
a horse every month, and a sheep every day, for sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
Herodotus has already told us, that the animals
were led to a pure place, and when the sacrificer had
invoked the god were killed, cut up, cooked, and then
laid out on delicate grass. The Magian then sang the
theogony, and after some time, the person who offered
the sacrifice "carried away the flesh, and used it at his
pleasure" (p. 85). Herodotus is better informed than
Xenophon; according to the Avesta only the head of
the animal belongs to the gods.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Obviously, as the
nature of the gods became more spiritualised&mdash;and the
reform prepared the way for this&mdash;the sacrifice of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
animals was restricted in this manner, so that it consisted
essentially in the offering of the animals, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in
the consecration of the flesh. We may conclude from
the statement in Athen&aelig;us, that only consecrated
flesh could be eaten at the court of the kings. Xerxes
certainly would not have sacrificed to Athene, "a lying
deity" of the Greeks, on the summit of Ilium; but he
might very well have selected the last eminence in
Asia Minor, "the many-fountained Ida," in order to
offer there a sacrifice of 1000 oxen to Ardvi&ccedil;ura for
his victory beyond the sea&mdash;a sacrifice which corresponds
exactly to the first offering made by Kava
Hu&ccedil;rava and Kava Vista&ccedil;pa to the same goddess for
victory over the Turanians.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>Temples and images are unknown to the Avesta.
The reform preserved for the nations of Iran the
traditional form of worship without images, on which
it was founded. The accounts of western writers, from
Herodotus and Xenophon downwards, establish the
fact that there were only sacrificial places on the
heights and consecrated fire-altars in Iran.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> But
this must not be taken to mean that the forms of
worship and the images of the nations with which the
Persians became acquainted after the foundation of
their supremacy, especially of their nearest neighbours,
the Semites on the Tigris and Euphrates, remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
without influence on them. On the monuments of
Darius we see the picture of Auramazda, cut exactly
after the pattern which the Assyrian monuments
exhibit in the portraiture of their god Asshur. We
are also told of images of Anahita. Berosus maintains
that Artaxerxes Mnemon erected statues to Aphrodite
Anaitis at Babylon, Ecbatana, and Susa, and taught
this form of worship to the Damascenes and Lydians.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
From this statement, taken in connection with the
account of Herodotus that the Persians had learnt to
sacrifice to Mylitta,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> the conclusion has been drawn
that Artaxerxes II. introduced the worship of Bilit
among the Persians. But it was not necessary to
teach this worship to the Damascenes and Lydians
(I. 358, 563), and even in the Avesta, Anahita as the
goddess of the heavenly water is the goddess of fertility.
Hence the statues made by Artaxerxes were, no doubt,
images of Anahita the goddess, whom he invokes along
with Auramazda and Mithra in his inscription at
Susa. Strabo describes the worship of the Magians at
the fire-altars of Cappadocia in a manner which completely
agrees with the accounts given in the Avesta,
and then adds that these functions were also performed
in the enclosures (&#963;&#951;&#1008;&#959;&#943;) which were consecrated
there to Anaitis, Amardatus, and Omanus, and
the image of Omanus was carried round in processions.
He concludes with the words: "this (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the form of
worship described) I have myself seen."<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> According
to this account, then, Amardate,<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Amesha
&Ccedil;penta Ameretat, who averts death, was worshipped
there beside Anahita, and Omanus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Amesha
&Ccedil;penta Vohumano, the protector of the flocks, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
an image. As this is all that we can discover about
the image-worship of the Persians, it is clear that the
influence of the picture-worship of Hither Asia and
Egypt had no great influence even on the western
nations of Iran. It is limited to the facts that Darius
added the symbolical picture of Auramazda to his inscriptions
without, however, building him a temple;
that a century after him Artaxerxes II. erected statues
and a temple to Anahita at Ecbatana; and that at a
later time a portable image of Vohumano was in
existence in Cappadocia.</p>

<p>The nucleus of the old religious conceptions of the
Arians&mdash;the desire to obtain increase and life from
the gods&mdash;has been sufficiently disclosed; and that
which could not be obtained in this world, the continuance
of the individual life, heaven was to bestow
upon them. This line was followed up by the reform;
the spirits of health and long life were added by the
priests to the circle of the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas. When
Zarathrustra had increased the means for the protection
and support of life; when it became a fixed
maxim that purity preserved life in this world and
ensured it after death; the sharp insistence on the
command of the pure and active and truthful life
which men ought to lead in this world, became
developed into the conception of a judgment on the
souls after death. He who had lived purely, and
given the Daevas no room to exercise their power on
his body, became himself pure and bright, and could
therefore enter after death as a pure spirit among the
spirits of light. Thus the Avesta announces that
"when body and soul have separated," the soul on
the third night after death, as soon as the brilliant sun
arises, and the victorious Mithra seats himself with
"pure brilliance" on the mountains, comes over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Hara berezaiti to the bridge of Chinvat, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the bridge
of assembly or of assembling, which leads to Garonmana,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to the dwelling of hymns, the abode of the
good gods. Here the Daevas and the gods contend for
the soul;<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> the judgment of the souls takes place;<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
here Auramazda asks the souls about their conduct.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
The pure soul, whose odour the Daevas dread,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> which
approaches with virtue and sanctity, is joined by the
other pure souls and by the souls of the dogs which
keep watch over the bridge of Chinvat,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> and the host
of the heavenly Yazatas brings the soul of the good
over the bridge into heaven. In contentment the
pure soul goes to the golden throne of Auramazda, to
the thrones of the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas, to the dwelling of
the pure. And Vohumano rises from his golden
throne and inquires of the pure one: "How hast
thou, O pure one, come hither out of the perishable to
the imperishable world?"<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> But the souls which come
to the bridge full of terror and sick, find no friend
there; the evil spirits, Vizaresha by name, lead them
bound down into the place of the bad, into the darkness,
the dwelling of the Druj.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>In the Veda the spirits of the fathers are invited to
the sacrificial meal; they are to enjoy the gifts which
are laid for them on the grass, to support the prayers
of their descendants, to keep away the evil spirits, and
to increase wealth. Each day water was poured there
for the forefathers, and corns of rice were scattered for
them; on the new moon the clans held the funeral
feast for the dead; and we are acquainted with the
consequences which attended expulsion from this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
banquet.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The belief in the spirits of the ancestors,
and their continued relation to their descendants,
existed also among the Arians of Iran, and the Avesta
alters it only so far as to limit consistently the assistance
given by the spirits of the fathers to the souls of
those who have lived in truth and purity, and have
thus found entrance into heaven. According to the
Avesta the Fravashis of the pure&mdash;this is the name
given to the Pitaras, or fathers of the Indians&mdash;protect
their descendants against the Daevas, help them in
distress and danger, and fight for their families on the
day of battle, if they are honoured and satisfied by
their descendants. It is only an old conception,
repeated in the Avesta, when we are told: "We
invoke the good, strong, holy Fravashis. Where
strong men fight in severe conflict, there come the
Fravashis with strong shield, iron helmet, and iron
weapons; with Mithra and the victorious wind they go
forward; strong warriors against the enemies, they are
mighty saviours; strong conquerors, they destroy the
victory of the enemy&mdash;the Turas (Turanians)."<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> It is
due to the additions and modifications introduced
by the priests that we hear that the hosts of the
Fravashis watch the body of Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa till the resurrection,
and the seed of Zarathrustra, and protect the
sleepers from the rising of the stars till midnight.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
As among the Arians of India the ancient belief in
the fathers was retained in spite of all changes of
the religious system, so also in Iran. At the close of
the year, on the intercalary days which were added
to it, the Fravashis come to their families, abide among
them for ten nights, and ask: "Who will receive us,
and sacrifice to us, and praise us?" and "if any one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
offers to them prayers and flesh and clothes, him they
bless, and in his dwelling there will be abundance of
oxen and men, swift horses and a strong car."<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The
Greeks had therefore reason to say that according to
the doctrine of the Magians the air was full of spirits.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>In another direction the system of the priests
deviated far more widely from the ancient conception
of the spirits of the ancestors. They held that only
the pure and bright part of the soul could live on
after death. Hence, even in the living they distinguished
this part from the polluted part, and in
the pure immortal half they saw the side created by
the good gods, its true being, the Fravashi or protecting
spirit allotted to each man. In the Avesta therefore
rules can be given for the invocation of this pure
part and nature of the individual soul, of the separate
Fravashis. The priests then transferred this notion to
the heavenly spirits, and even to Auramazda himself.
His purest nature, his best self, must be praised and
invoked for aid. Auramazda says to Zarathrustra in
the book of the law: "O Zarathrustra, praise thou my
Fravashi, the Fravashi of Auramazda, the greatest,
best, most intelligent, best-formed, highest in holiness,
whose soul is the holy word."<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> And in the prayers
we are told: "We praise the Fravashis of the Amesha
&Ccedil;pentas, of the holy &Ccedil;raosha, of Mithra, together with
all the Fravashis of the heavenly Yazatas. I invoke the
Fravashi of the holy Zarathrustra, the Fravashis of the
men of the ancient law, and the Fravashis of the men
of the new law, the good mighty Fravashis of the
pure, of the nearest relations, and of my own soul."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
The Persians at the king's gate, according to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Greeks, set apart a separate table at each meal with
bread and food for the "demon" of the king, and at a
Persian banquet the host, according to Plutarch, calls
on his guests, "to honour the demon of king Artaxerxes."
Hence it clearly follows that the priestly
doctrine of the Fravashis of the living was current
even in Western Iran under the Ach&aelig;menids.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Zarathrustra had increased the means for keeping
off the evil ones, and had made the struggle against
the wicked spirits easier for men. But the time will
come when the struggle will be no longer necessary,
and the bright spirits alone will rule. This doctrine
is indicated even in the Gathas.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> In the book of the
law Zarathrustra says to Angromainyu: he will smite
the Daevas till &Ccedil;aoshyant is born from the water of
Kan&ccedil;ava in the eastern region.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> &Ccedil;aoshyant, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
useful, the saviour, is called in the Avesta, "the
sublime, the victorious;" he will smite the Druj, and
Aeshma will bow before him. He will make the
world to live for ever, without age and death; the
dead will rise again, and the living will be immortal.
Vohumano will smite Akomano, Asha will kill the
lies. Haurvatat and Ameretat will destroy thirst and
hunger: "The evil-doer Angromainyu, robbed of his
dominion, bows himself."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> This doctrine of the Avesta
also was well known to the western world. In Herodotus
Prexaspes tells Cambyses that when the dead
rise again he will see Smerdis and Astyages.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Theopompus
of Chios tells us: Zoroaster had proclaimed
that there would be a time in which the dead will
arise, and men will be immortal, and everything will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
be done by their invocations. Last of all, Hades will
pass away; men will then be happy; they will need no
nourishment, and throw no shadows, and the god who
will accomplish this rests for a time, but not a long
time for a god.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> It is true that men required no
nourishment when &Ccedil;aoshyant had appeared, in the
meaning of the Avesta, for Haurvatat and Ameretat
had overcome hunger and thirst as well as sickness
and death; and as the dark side of man was taken
away, and only the bright side remained, they could
not cast any shadows.</p>

<p>As already remarked, it was part of the duty of the
priests to bring the ancient legends of the old time into
harmony with the new doctrine. We saw that the
legends of Iran began with the happy age of Yima,
and his reign of a thousand years full of increase and
blessing. This conception of a perfect age for the
creatures of earth at the very beginning of things did
not suit with the struggle, which, according to the new
doctrine, Angromainyu commenced immediately after
the creation. The priests, therefore, conceived the
beginning of things in a different manner. In their
system Auramazda first created the heaven, then the
water, then the earth and the trees, and after these
the four-footed bull, and the two-legged pure man
Gayo maretan.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> In the Avesta the primeval bull and
man are at the head, and time extends from Gayo
maretan to &Ccedil;aoshyant.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> The books of the Parsees
then tell us that Angromainyu killed the primeval
man and bull, but from the seed of the bull proceeded
a pair of oxen, and then all kinds of good animals;
and out of the seed of Gayo maretan grew up the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
man and the first woman. As we have already remarked,
our fragments of the Avesta identify the soul
of the first created bull with the Drva&ccedil;pa, the ancient
guardian spirit of the flocks; next to Gayo maretan
they place Haoshyangha, the Paradhata (p. 36), and
represent him as sacrificing to Ardvi&ccedil;ura, Vayu, and
Ashi vanguhi, in order to obtain the dominion over
the evil spirits.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> After him Takhmo urupa rules the
earth of seven parts; he sacrifices to Vayu in order to
obtain grace to restrain Angromainyu for thirty years.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
Then, according to the system of the priests, follows
the dominion of Yima the son of Vivanghana, during
which there was no cold and no heat, no age and no
death, as was represented in the old views. Yima
kindles the red-glowing fire. Flocks and men, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
life, increase; and the earth must be made larger. The
end of this happy period, and the death of Yima, is
brought about, according to the priests, by the fact that
Yima refused to be the preacher of the doctrine of
Auramazda, that he was unable to maintain purity
and truth, and began to "love lying speech" (p. 41).
As Yima was born to Vivanghana as a reward for his
Haoma sacrifice, there follows a series of those who
have offered the sacrifice: Athwya, Thrita, Pourusha&ccedil;pa,
and their sons. To the first Thraetaona was
born, who smites the serpent Dahaka; to Thrita Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa,
who smites the serpent &Ccedil;ruvara; and to Pourusha&ccedil;pa
was born Zarathrustra, who receives the law
of Auramazda and proclaims it; by this law the
Daevas will be warded off till &Ccedil;aoshyant appears,
when everything which has once had life will come
to life again.</p>

the Avesta (p. 79), some have sought to draw the conclusion, that
this is the supreme principle, and that Auramazda and Angromainyu
proceeded from it. This is no less incorrect than if it were maintained
that according to the Christian dogma God and the devil owed their
origin to eternity. In the Avesta Zrvana akarana does not assume an
important place either at the creation or in the worship. I have
already remarked above, that the spirits of light are called in the
Rigveda sons of Aditi, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the unlimited, the eternal. Parallel
similitudes which, however, mean no more than the eternity of the
gods, could be made even among the Arians of Iran. But there is a
difference between speaking in similes, and derivation from a principle.
The faith of Iran was not a philosophical system, but a religion; a
religion cannot combine the good and evil god into one unity. It is
only when speculation becomes master over religion, that conceptions
of this kind can find a place; and this speculation, which sought for
primeval cosmical unity, arrived as a fact at an identical origin for the
good and evil spirit; but this was not the case with the Avesta.
Centuries after the establishment of the canon we find the oldest form
of such teaching in a demand made to the Armenian Christians that
they should join the faith of Auramazda. In this we are told that the
great deity Zrovan had sacrificed for a thousand years, and had
received two sons, Ormuzd and Ahriman. The first had created heaven
and earth, the other had opposed him with evil works. About the same
time Theodorus of Mopsuestia in Cilicia (Phot. "Biblioth." p. 63, ed.
Bekker), tells us: "Zoroaster called the creator of all things Zaruam,
and described him as fate;" and in the sixth century Damascius ("De
prim. princip." p. 384) writes: "The Magi and the whole Arian nation
call the Whole and One in thought, space and time respectively; from
this One arose the good and evil god, Oromasdes and Areimanius, or as
others say light and darkness were divided before these." The sect of
the Zarvanites, who deviated from the faith of Zoroaster, inasmuch as
they carried these principles still further, has been already mentioned
(p. 67).</p></div>

Magi in Thrace contradicts his own statement that the Magi did not
venture to kill any one, and the whole conception of the Avesta. If
Cambyses is said to have caused twelve Persians to be buried alive, this
is not to be regarded as a sacrifice, but as a barbarous form of execution,
which occurs also under the Sassanids. What Herodotus says of the
fourteen boys offered by Amestris as a sacrifice, if true, must have its
origin in some other superstition, not in the Avesta; and the actions
of Amestris and Parysatis in this direction, as recorded by Ctesias,
were in any cases crimes, not sacrifices.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE PRIESTHOOD OF IRAN</h3>


<p>In the form in which we have them the books of the
Avesta are the work of the priests of Eastern Iran.
According to the evidence repeatedly furnished by
them, there were three orders in Sogdiana and Bactria:
priests, warriors, and husbandmen. This sequence,
which is uniformly preserved both in the invocations
and in the book of the law, shows that the priests
had risen above the warriors, and claimed to be the
first of the three orders.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>In considering the civilisation of the Bactrian kingdom
we found ourselves compelled by the proximity
of the nations of the steppes to assume, that when
the Arians had become established there, the tribes
which had a capacity or love for battle, undertook the
protection of the land, the flocks and fields, against
the incursions of the nomads of the north, and made
battle and strife their special vocation. Such attacks
increased with the increasing culture of Bactria, and
led to a consolidation of powers; these clans raised
one of their number distinguished in battle to be their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
leader, or followed him, and thus was laid the basis
for the foundation of a great state. The importance
ascribed in the Avesta to the splendour of majesty&mdash;we
find the personification of good government in the
Avesta among the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas&mdash;in combination
with the battles which, as we learn from the book, the
princes of Bactria carried on against the Turanians, and
with the statements in the West Iranian Epos about
the kingdom of the Bactrians, together with the later
condition of the country, allowed us to draw the conclusion
that at one time the kings of Bactria were not
without power and importance. They reigned, surrounded
by the families of the warriors, who were
enabled by their possessions in lands and flocks, to
devote themselves to the practice of arms and to
battle.  The invocations to Mithra, Verethraghna,
and Vayu, bear upon them very evident traces of a
war-like spirit (p. 110, 114). That the spirits of the
sky, which once fought with the cloud-dragons, have
become mortal heroes in the Avesta, also proves&mdash;since
even among other nations the Epic poetry which
follows periods of warlike excitement transforms shapes
of the sky into heroes of old time&mdash;that once on a
time Bactria had experienced a period of warfare,
when difficulties arose which it was mainly the business
of the monarchy and the nobles to settle. The
Avesta can tell us of arms and robes as well as of
palaces with pillars and turrets; of earthen, iron,
silver and golden vessels; of mats, carpets, and adornments
of gold,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> such as are found among noble
families; and those hecatombs of horses, cattle, and
sheep which the heroes in the Avesta sacrifice to
Anahita and Drva&ccedil;pa, in order to obtain their favour
by victory, are no doubt borrowed from the sacrifices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
which princes and nobles were wont to offer in cases
where the numbers must be enlarged in honour of the
heroes. Yet we see that Xerxes orders a thousand
oxen to be sacrificed at one time. We have already
shown (IV. 390), how important and pre-eminent
was the position which the races of the warriors, "the
princes," occupied on the Indus and the Ganges, and
what respect they commanded among "the free Indians"
in the Panjab, even in the fourth century <small>B.C.</small>
That a warlike nobility of a similar character, attitude,
and position, existed in Eastern Iran, is the less to be
doubted, as the order of warriors in the Avesta is
denoted by a name (<i>rathaestar</i>) which goes back to the
chariots of war. The husbandmen, who were settled
beside and among them, bear in the Avesta the name
of Va&ccedil;trya,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> but the word Vae&ccedil;u is also used for them,
which simply repeats the name of the Indian Vai&ccedil;yas.</p>

<p>Like the Arians of India, the Arians of Iran believed
in the power of the correct invocations, prayers, and
sacrifice; among them also the sacrifice strengthens
the gods and increases their power. In India too,
the priests, and minstrels, and sacrificers handed down
in their families the knowledge of the effective invocations
and ceremonies which exercised compulsion on
the gods, and the same was the case in Eastern Iran;
priestly families arose at a very early period. They
did not here retain the name of supplicators, as in
India; but are called Athravas in the Avesta. In the
Veda Atharvan kindles the sacrificial fire, and among
the Arians of India the incantations of the race of
Atharvan passed from the most powerful. In a similar
way powerful invocations and sentences were handed
down in Iran from father to son in the race of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>Athravas. These families preserved the ancient invocations
to Mithra, Verethraghna, Anahita, Tistrya,
which are preserved to us in the Avesta, though in a
modified form. The god Haoma instructs Zarathrustra
to praise him, as the other fire-priests had done
(p. 124). The reform which bears the name of Zarathrustra
cannot have left the condition of the priests
unchanged. The doctrine may, as invocations in the
Avesta would seem to show, have first found adherents
in the race of Haechata&ccedil;pa, to which Zarathrustra
belonged, and to which he first proclaimed his law
(131), and next in the race of Jama&ccedil;pa and Frashaostra,
who are spoken of as Zarathrustra's most
zealous followers.  According to the creed of the
Parsees the good law also came to Aderbat Mahresfant
by family descent (p. 62). These new races of priests,
who knew the sayings, invocations, and prayers of
Zarathrustra, would then be joined by those among
the races of the old fire-priests who approved of
the reform, and the priesthood thus formed would be
further strengthened by those who, deeply impressed
by the new doctrine, sought and found reception as
pupils into a family of the priests, thus entering into
their circle, and becoming members of their families.
United by a new doctrine and settled tenets, the
priests who represented the reform would become
united together more firmly than the priestly families
of the old time.</p>

<p>The priesthood could very well claim precedence
of the warriors; on their prayers and sayings, their
knowledge of the custom of sacrifice, depended the
favour of the gods, the power of averting evil spirits,
the removal of pollution, salvation in this world and
the next. Yet they could not obtain such a position
as the Brahmans held on the Ganges after the reform of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the ancient faith, and the victory of Brahman over
Indra. For in Iran there was no order of &Ccedil;udras, no
vanquished remnant of an old population, which
created a sharp line of division even among the orders
of the Aryas; and moreover the Brahmans were the
first-born of Brahman, a purer incarnation of the divine
nature than any other order. The world had not
emanated from Auramazda; there were in Iran no
gradations of beings in which the divine essence
existed in a more or less pure condition. All had to
fight against evil deities and against evil; the priests
were the leaders in this struggle&mdash;this leadership and
nothing more could they claim. In their lives they
studied especial purity of body and mind; and they
were pre-eminently "the pure men." Only by their
means, at any rate with their assistance, could sacrifice
be offered; from their mouths alone could the correct
invocations be uttered to the gods, and the evil ones
be driven away. Men were compelled to submit to
the rules of the life acceptable to the gods of light, of
pure conversation, which were accurately known to the
priests only; they had to take upon themselves the
expiations which the priests prescribed, in order to
wipe out offences and sins and their consequences&mdash;but
they had not to reverence in them, as was the case
beyond the Indus, a class of creatures raised by birth
to a higher level. Hence the sharp separation of the
priesthood from the rest of the orders, in the Brahmanic
fashion, was at once placed out of the question.
The priesthood of Iran perpetuated their knowledge
and wisdom in their families; but they had not the
right to bar all entrance into their families or their
order on the score of higher birth, or to prohibit the
marriage of priests with women of other orders, on
the ground of their superior nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>From our fragments of the Avesta we may assume
that although, as is obvious, the precedence of the
priests above the remaining orders was strongly marked,
and they were especially denoted as "pure men," the
limits of their political and social position were far
more modest than those of the Brahmans. So far as
we can see, the Avesta allots no special income to the
priests beyond the camels, horses, or small cattle given
to them by warriors and husbandmen in quittance for
the purifications they have performed. The penalties
also which have to be paid in expiation of certain
offences are to be given to "the pure men," and the
Avesta repeatedly recommends the presentation of
gifts to them. On the other hand, the priests do not
possess the exclusive right to perform purifications.
The Vendidad merely says that any one who wishes to
perform purifications must have learned the law from
one of the purifiers, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> it is only the instruction of
the priest which is indispensable in this matter. Any
one who performs purification without such instruction
(except in the case of necessary purifications, p. 230),
will take away from the places where it is performed,
"food and fatness, health and all remedies, prosperity,
luxuriance and growth, and increase of corn and
fodder; and corn and fodder will not return to such
places until for three days and nights the holy &Ccedil;raosha
has been praised at the burning fire with bound withes
and uplifted Haoma." The uncertified purifier is to
be put in chains, his clothes taken from him, and his
head cut off.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> If it was permitted to learn the purifications,
it follows that men not of priestly descent
could enter the order of the Athravas, and the boundary
line between this order and the rest was not impassable.
Among the Parsees of India any one can become a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
priest. The duties of the priest, according to the
book of the law, consist in watching and tending the
sacred fire, in praising the good spirits, in offering
sacrifice, and performing purifications, and in the
ceaseless study of the holy scriptures. The priest is to
be provided with a mortar made according to certain
rules, a cup (for the Haoma sacrifice), the snake-switch
(a stick for killing impure animals), and the Paitidana,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a piece of cloth for veiling the mouth, in order that
he may not approach the sacred fire with breath that
is possibly impure. For the rest, the Vendidad lays
down the rule that the priests are to be patient and
content, and satisfied with a little bread, and they
ought to eat what is offered to them.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Auramazda
says; "Many men, O Zarathrustra, carry the Paitidana,
the serpent-switch, the sacred bundle of twigs, without
being guided according to the law. These are wrongly
called priests; do not thou call them priests, O Zarathrustra.
He who lies the whole night without praising
or hearing, or reciting, or learning, or teaching&mdash;call
not such an one a priest. Call him a priest, O pure
Zarathrustra, who inquires of the pure intelligence
the whole night, of the wisdom which purifies from
sins and makes the heart wide, which has merits in store
on the bridge of Chinvat, and causes us to attain the
purity and bliss of Paradise."<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> The Avesta distinguishes
different classes of priests, but the distinction
only rests on the various acts which they perform in
the sacred rites. The first rank is taken by the
Zaotar, who utters the prayers and invocations (the
Hotar, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Repeater of the Veda); next to him
apparently is the &Ccedil;raoshavareza, "who speaks very
wise and truthful things;"<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> he bears the club of &Ccedil;raosha,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>in order to keep the evil spirits at a distance from the
sacred acts; then comes the Atarevaksha, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
priest who causes the fire to increase, and attends to
the worship of it; then the A&ccedil;natar (the Washer), who
has to cleanse the instruments of sacrifice to keep
them from pollution; the Frabaretar, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Carrier,
etc. In the modern ritual of the Parsees all the duties
of the sacred service have been transferred to the
Zaotar and the Ra&ccedil;pi, which latter discharges the
functions of ministering priest.</p>

<p>If we were only approximately correct in placing the
date of Zarathrustra and the reform of the ancient
faith at 1000 <small>B.C.</small>, the formation of this priestly order,
which took place on the basis of the new doctrine,
may have come to an end about the year 800 <small>B.C.</small>
We saw that from this date onwards the spread of
the new doctrine must have begun in the west of Iran
towards the Medes and Persians, since there existed
among the Medes from 700 <small>B.C.</small> an hereditary priesthood,
charged with the worship of the gods according
to the regulations of Zarathrustra, and in this century
it was already sufficiently numerous to be placed as an
equal division beside the tribes of the Medes.</p>

<p>We have no better information about the priests of
the West than we have on the political and social
position of the priests of Eastern Iran. They are not
called Athravas but Magush. This name is first found
in the inscription which Darius caused to be cut on the
rock-wall of Behistun; afterwards it was consistently
used by Western writers, from Herodotus to Agathias,
for the priests of Iran. The Avesta has the words
<i>magha</i> and <i>maghavan</i>, i.&nbsp;e. the powerful, the great,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
does not use it of the priests, which are always called
Athravas. If the last title is taken from the fire-worship,
the first allows us to see the importance of the
priests. He who can use incantations to the gods and
spirits&mdash;can summon or remove them&mdash;is the mighty
one, the powerful. If in this name we have evidence
of the respect with which the laity of Western Iran
looked up to the priests, the difference between the
names in the East and West shows that there were
priestly races among the Medes and Persians before
the religion of Zarathrustra reached them. Had not
such existed before the reform, and had they not
possessed a definite name in the West&mdash;had priestly
families become known there for the first time at the
rise of the reform&mdash;they would never have had any
other name than that of Athravas. Even without this
positive proof we might assume that from all antiquity
there had been priests among the Medes and Persians
who understood how to invoke the gods of light in the
old Arian faith&mdash;Mithra and Verethraghna, Vayu and
Tistrya&mdash;and tend the fire which destroyed demons.
When the new doctrine reached from the East to
Ragha and then to Media (p. 96), the old races who
passed over to the new faith united with the families
the members of which were the prophets of the new
doctrine. The teachers of the Medes in old times,
which Pliny called successors of Zarathrustra, might
have stood at the head of this transformation of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
ancient priestly families, of the creation of the Median
priesthood on the basis of the new religion (p. 92).
However this may have been, the priestly families
among the Medes were so numerous, their connection
and union so close and firmly fixed, that they could be
counted as a sixth tribe beside the other five Median
tribes.</p>

<p>Among the tribes of the Persians Herodotus mentions
no tribe of Magi. It would be a mistake to
conclude from this that there were originally no
priests among the Persians, and to put faith in Xenophon's
statement that Cyrus was the first to give the
Magians the care of the sacred fire, "because he
preferred to go on board with the pious rather than
the impious."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> No one will maintain that the Persians
in ancient times were without worship and
religious rites, or that when they accepted the doctrine
of Zarathrustra, which did not permit sacrifice without
Magians, they used the services of none but alien
priests. Such a proceeding would be absurd. The
proper conclusion from the fact that Herodotus does
not mention a tribe of Magians among the Persians
is that the priestly families there were less numerous;
they had not broken away from the tribal connections
to which they originally belonged, and formed themselves
into a separate community. Further, from the
fact that the priestly families of the Persians in old
times had not formed themselves into a separate community,
we may conclude&mdash;and indeed the conclusion
follows from the position of Media and the notice in
the Avesta about Ragha, and the observation about
the ancient teachers of the Medes, who are said to
have been followers of Zarathrustra&mdash;that the reform
of the faith first came from Bactria to the Medes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
that it was adopted and more strongly represented
among them, and so passed on to the Persians. We
cannot doubt that there were Persians belonging to
the order of Magians. If Plato and his pupils call
Zoroaster the "teacher of the Magians," and at the
same time "a Persian," they must assume that there
were Magians among the Persians; if, according to
Plato's statement, the four teachers of the heirs to the
Persian throne, of which one had to teach the Magism
of Zoroaster, were selected out of "all the Persians;"&mdash;if
at the time of Xerxes there were Persians who
wrote on the doctrine of Zoroaster, they must have
been initiated in the wisdom and knowledge of the
Magians, and have known their invocations and customs;
the contents of the holy scriptures and the
scriptures themselves can hardly have been hidden
from them. In order to prove that the Magians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
the priests, belonged exclusively to the Medes, the
fact has been brought forward that the Persians, after
Darius had dethroned the Pseudo-Smerdis, celebrated
each year the feast of the slaughter of the Magians,
at which no Magian allowed himself to be seen, but
all were obliged to remain at home.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The Magophonia
was not the celebration of a victory over the
Magi generally, but over the removal of a usurper, and
the restoration of the dominion to the Ach&aelig;menids,
which had been taken from them by one who happened
to be a Magian. Herodotus at any rate calls
this Magian a Mede.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Darius contents himself with
calling him the "Magian." Hence there is no ground
to doubt that both before and after the reform, families
of the Persians were charged with the worship
of the gods; the less so because Plato, as already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
remarked, represents the heirs to the throne in Persia
as being instructed in the doctrine of Zoroaster, while
Strabo and Pausanias speak expressly of "Persian
Magi," and the chief Magian is enumerated among
the tribes "which dwell in the districts of Persis."<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>When the dominion of the Ach&aelig;menids had been
established over Iran, the priestly families of all the
West must have been united into one community.
There is no doubt that this remained an order in
which the priestly wisdom and knowledge were traditional.
Strabo, like Herodotus, calls the Magians a
tribe; he adds that the members of it sought after a
holy life. The tribe was large, he tells us in another
place; Magians could be found even in Cappadocia.
Ammianus also informs us that the Magians handed
down their doctrines to later times, each by his
descendants. Growing up through centuries from a
small number, the Magians became a nation, and
being regarded as dedicated to the service of the
gods, they had acquired respect through their religion.
They inhabited open villages, lived according to a
law of their own, and possessed fruitful fields in the
district called Nis&aelig;a. Agathias also calls the Magians
a tribe.<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> But the separation of the priestly order in
the West cannot have been more strict than that of
the Athravas in the East. Marriage with the women
of other orders was not forbidden, nor transition
from other orders into that of the Medes. The
Avesta speaks of the teacher and the pupil (p. 203);
and it is expressly said&mdash;though the statement comes
from the beginning of the third century of our era&mdash;that
the Magians among the Persians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Magians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
under the Arsacids, instructed even those who were
not Persians in their doctrine, but only at the special
command of the king.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>We find the Magians in close proximity to the rulers
of the Medes and Persians; they were not without
importance and influence. In Herodotus they tell
Astyages that they had and would have great honours
from him.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Xenophon speaks of them as determining,
at the time of Cyrus, which god is to be honoured on
each day.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Cambyses charges Magians with the duty
of watching the grave of Cyrus, and this office became
hereditary in their families;<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> he also entrusts a
Magian with the care of the royal household, while he
marches with the army into the remote parts of Egypt
and Nubia. The inscriptions of Darius showed us
how much in earnest he was with the doctrines and
regulations of the religion&mdash;how lively was his faith.
On his march to Hellas, Xerxes was accompanied by
Osthanes, a man skilled in the priestly dogmas, and by
Magians; they offer sacrifice, and charm the storms.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
The sacred fire which was carried before the kings<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
was conducted by Magians, and so also were the sacred
chariot, the sacred horses of Mithra and the sun-god,
in the campaigns of the Ach&aelig;menids (p. 167). Of
greater importance was it that the heirs to the throne
in Persia were instructed, as Plato tells us, in the
Magism of Zoroaster,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> which could only be done by
Magians. Nicolaus of Damascus relates that the
Persian princes were instructed by the Magians in
truthfulness, justice, and the laws of their country;<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
and, according to Plutarch, Magians were the educators<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of the Persian princes; Magians also under the Ach&aelig;menids
performed the consecration at the accession of
a new king.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> We are also told that this king of the
Medes and that of the Persians, took the advice of the
Magians on important occasions. Under the Arsacids
they formed, along with the members of the race of
the kings, the supreme council of the kingdom; in
the time when this dynasty was at its height they
ruled, as Pliny told us, "over the king of kings;"
and we have seen (p. 60) that their influence under
the Sassanids, at court, in the administration of law,
and in politics, was even more powerful.</p>

<p>Herodotus maintains that the Magians also occupied
themselves with soothsaying and prophecy; like
Ctesias, he ascribes to the Medes the interpretation of
certain dreams and other miraculous acts. Of such
interpretations and prophesying on the part of the
priests the Avesta knows nothing, and those Greeks
who were better informed, warmly contested the assertion
that the Magians were occupied with such
things. Plato tells us: "The Magism of Zoroaster is
the worship of the gods;" and Aristotle assures us that
the Magians knew nothing of soothsaying.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> What
Herodotus tells us, on the other side, he certainly did
not invent, but repeats after his informants. The
Medo-Persian Epos, which, though indirectly, forms
the basis of Herodotus' account of the rise of Cyrus
and the death of Cambyses, allowed a wide field, even
in the account of the fall of the Assyrian empire
(III. 264), to the astrological and prophetic wisdom of
the Chald&aelig;ans. From this we may conclude that
prophecies of the Chald&aelig;ans were not left out of
sight at the overthrow of Astyages. In Nicolaus of
Damascus it is a Chald&aelig;an of Babylon who expounds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
her dream to the mother of Cyrus,<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> and possibly
the kings of the Medes followed the example of the
Assyrian and Babylonian courts in having astrologers
and interpreters of dreams from Babylon about
them.</p>

<p>Whatever was the influence employed by the Magians
at the court of the Ach&aelig;menids, the Arsacids and
Sassanids, their influence was of a moral nature; it
was only through the effect of religion on the heart
and conscience of the king, that they could work;
their position did not rest on any hierarchical institutions.
In Iran the priesthood had no real means
of power which permitted it to come forward in opposition
to the power of the State. The priest was a
subject of the king like any one else. It was within
the king's power to proceed at his pleasure with the
severest corporal punishment against the Magi, and
it is abundantly clear that the kings did not shrink
from inflicting such punishments, even if we do not
regard as established facts the stories that Astyages
impaled the Magians who had given him a false report,
and that Darius caused forty Magians to be executed
at once.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>Diogenes Laertius relates that the Magians lived on
lentils, bread and cheese, which agrees with the Avesta
to the extent that the priests are there commanded to
be content with a little food.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> What Herodotus tells
us of the duties and occupation of the Magians agrees
entirely with the rules given in the Avesta for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
Athravas. No one could sacrifice without a Magian;
the sacrifices were offered on high places (in this Xenophon
agrees<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>) or in "pure places;" the most delicate
grass was spread&mdash;we remember the importance of the
Ku&ccedil;a-grass in the Veda and the Brahmanas&mdash;on this
grass the flesh of the sacrifice was laid; the Magians
sang the theogony, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> long sacrificial prayers, and the
sacred rite is fulfilled. Herodotus also asserts that
the Magians took great pride in killing serpents, ants,
and other winged and creeping things with their own
hands; that human life was greatly respected by them;
that the dog was held in high honour (p. 86); and
the corpses of the Magians were exposed to dogs or
birds of prey. This he declares that he knows to be
the truth; Xenophon represents the Magians as beginning
their songs of praise with the break of day, and
as offering their sacrifices at certain places, which were
selected for the gods. Curtius relates that they sang
native songs.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Strabo told us above that the Magians
sought after a holy life; he observes also that whatever
was the god to which they sacrificed they first prayed
to fire. At every sacrifice the Magians conducted the
sacred rite; the victims were not slain with the knife
but struck down with a club. No part of the flesh
of the victim was set apart for the deity, for they
declared that the god required only the soul of the
animal; yet according to some they placed a small
portion of the fat in the fire. "In Cappadocia there
were enclosed places," Strabo continues, "in the midst
of which was an altar, heaped up with ashes. On this
the Magians kept up the unquenchable fire. Each
day they went and sang for an hour before the fire,
holding in their hands a bundle of twigs. On their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
heads they wore tiaras of felt, which fell down on
both sides so far that the side-pieces covered the lips."<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
Pausanias, who observed the worship of the Magians
in the cities of Lydia, says: "At both places there
was a shrine with a cell, and in the cell is an altar;
on this are ashes the colour of which is not the
ordinary colour of ashes. When the Magian comes
into the cell, he lays the dry wood on the altar, puts
the tiara on his head, and sings the invocation to some
god or another, in a barbarian manner, quite unintelligible
to the Hellenes; but he sings from a book.
Then the pieces of wood, without being kindled, ought
to become lighted, and a flame from them should flash
all round the cell."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

(p. 60). The derivation of the name Magus from the Turanian <i>imga</i>
(apparently = honourable) can only be adopted by those who regard
the Magians as descendants of the Turanians, or at any rate as containing
a strong admixture of Turanians; a view which rests on the
theory that the second series in the inscriptions of the Ach&aelig;menids is
the Median translation of the Persian inscriptions. With this view
I cannot agree; all that we learn from the Greeks of the customs,
manners, and names of the Medes bears the mark of an Arian origin,
and is in harmony with what is attributed to the Persians. In the inscription
of the second class at Behistun, Gaumata is not called <i>imga</i>
but <i>magush</i>.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE LAW OF THE PRIESTS.</h3>


<p>The rules concerning purity and purification, the
expiations and penances necessary to avert the Daevas,
which we possess in the Vendidad of the Avesta, are
only the remnant of a far more comprehensive law.
From the list of books and chapters traditional among
the Parsees, we can see that it was intended to include
not only all the invocations and prayers which the
worship required, the rules of sacrifice, and the entire
ritual, together with the Calendar of the year of the
Church, but also the arrangement of the process of
law, the civil and criminal code, and, moreover, rules
for agriculture and medicine. If to this we add the
statements and quotations of the Greeks (p. 53), we
may assume that the scriptures of Eastern Iran comprised
the whole sum of the knowledge of the priests.
In the Avesta the Athravas had sketched the ideal
picture of the correct conduct pleasing to Auramazda
in every department of life. How far the princes of
Bactria and the viceroys of Cyaxares and the Ach&aelig;menids,
or even these princes themselves, and the
judges, wished or allowed themselves to be bound in
their decisions by these regulations of the priests, may
be left out of the question. The priests here, like the
Brahmans in India, could only influence the action of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the State and those charged with it, so far as the
reverence for the principles of religion and the force of
their own authority extended.</p>

<p>The existing part of the law has obviously arisen
out of the questions and considerations sketched
above, which in consequence of the reform must have
forced themselves into the circles of the priests. The
reform also required above all things purity from men,
but no supernatural purity, such as the Brahmans
demanded. The body is not in the Avesta, as it was
to the Brahmans and after them to the Buddhists, the
impure prison of the soul which must be abandoned;
on the contrary the Avesta rejoices in its health and
vigour. It requires that the body should be kept
pure from filth, from contamination by the impure,
which gives the Daevas power over mankind, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> it
demands the exclusion of the harmful side of nature;
it desires that the soul should be pure from pollution,
freed from untruthfulness, lying, and deceit, which are
contradictory to the nature of the clear bright gods,
and Auramazda, and make men companions of the
Daevas, and sharers in their nature. In other words,
it demands the invigoration of the light and wholesome
side of man. The kingdom of the good spirits is
truth, increase, and life; the kingdom of the evil is
deception and falsehood, lying, destruction, and death.
The Avesta praises Auramazda as purity itself; and
next to him Asha vahista, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the best purity; the
gods are chiefly extolled as "the pure," and Zarathrustra
as the master and teacher of purity. The
Avesta repeatedly declares "that purity after birth is
the best thing for men." Hence it is the foremost of
all duties to keep the soul and body pure. The
worshipper of Auramazda must preserve his purity by
good thoughts, words, and works; truth is required<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
in thinking, speaking, and acting; uprightness and
honesty in all the relations of life; the sacredness of
promises and pledges, and solemn assurances, at which
Mithra is summoned to bear witness. It is an old
function of the god which appears here. He is the
guardian of the word, and the compact. "Mithra is
twenty-fold between friends and kinsmen, thirty-fold
between tradespeople, forty-fold between companions
who live together, fifty-fold between man and wife,
sixty-fold between associates in sacrifice, seventy-fold
between scholar and teacher, eighty-fold between step-son
and step-parents, ninety-fold between brothers, a
hundred-fold between son and father." "Miserable are
the houses, without descendants the dwellings, inhabited
by those who deceive Mithra. Miserably does
the cloven-footed cow go on the wrong path, which is
oppressed by the burden of Mithra-deceiving men."<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
In accordance with this view deception is in the eyes
of the law the worst offence; worse than robbery or
theft. Evil-speaking and calumny also are, according
to the Vendidad, "lies and sins" against Mithra. The
gravest offence of this kind is the calumny by which
"a pure man" is disparaged "with a man of another
religion," for this sin is committed with full knowledge,
and by a man's own intelligence; and the worst of all
lies is teaching a false law. "One who teaches such a
law," says the Vendidad, "does no better than if he
killed a thousand horses, slew the men in a village
inhabited by worshippers of Auramazda, or carried off
the cows on the wrong way."<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>It is not the least proof of the currency of the
doctrines of the Avesta in the West of Iran that their
ethical side, which gathers round the command of
truthfulness, was there most distinctly recognised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
King Darius has already told us that "the lie" had
brought his kingdom into rebellion; the leaders of the
rebellious lands, who gave themselves out to be descendants
of the ancient royal families, he calls "liars
against the kingdom." From their youth up, Herodotus
tells us, the children of the Persians were
instructed in truthfulness. He adds: Among the
Persians it was forbidden to speak of that which it
was forbidden to do; the Avesta requires truth "in
thought, speech, and action." Lying and borrowing,
Herodotus says, passed with the Persians for the most
disgraceful acts, for they were of opinion that any
one who contracted debts was generally compelled to
tell lies. The Avesta says: "He who does not restore
that which has been borrowed, seeks day and night to
deceive the creditor." Plato states that the heirs to
the Persian throne had, besides three others, a teacher
whose special business it was to instruct them in truth.
Xenophon assures us that pledges and oaths were
religiously kept among the Persians; and Diodorus,
that the pledge of hands was the strongest security
among them.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Practice in Persia was, it is true, not
equal to these injunctions, however sharply expressed;
on the contrary, we often find the two in the most
glaring contradiction.</p>

<p>Not falsehood and lies only, but also laziness and
sloth pollute the soul of man. The pious man must
rise early. &Ccedil;raosha awakes the bird Parodarsh, we
are told in the book of the law. At the return of the
divine Ushahina, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the morning (p. 108), this
bird speaks to those who are in their beds: "Friend,
up, arise. Praise purity, and the Daevas will fly away.
Long sleep, O man, is not good for thee. The Bush<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>yan&ccedil;ta
runs up to thee, who lays again in sleep the
whole corporeal world. Turn yourselves not away
from the three best things: good thinking, speaking,
and acting. He who rises first will come into Paradise;
he who first brings pure, dry, old, well-hewn
wood to the fire of Auramazda, him will the fire bless
(p. 122)."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> The pious man should be industrious
and work; the best work is that which increases
nourishment and fruit for men and animals, which
furthers the increase and life of the world, and thus
diminishes the kingdom of the evil, the power of the
dark spirits. For this reason running water and
growing fruits should be spread over the earth; "the
field should be tilled, and trees planted which produce
food." "When there are shoots," the law-book says,
"the Daevas are in alarm; when there are stalks, the
Daevas weep; when there are ears, the Daevas hiss;
when there are grains, the Daevas fly."<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> "In the
house where there are most ears, the Daevas are
smitten most heavily." "The earth is not glad
which lies untilled. The greatest pleasure is given to
the earth where a pure man builds his house, provided
with fire and cattle, and good flocks, with wife and
child, where most corn, fodder, and grain is produced
by husbandry, where the dry land is most watered,
where fruit-bearing trees are planted, where cattle and
beasts of draught leave the most urine."<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> "He who
plants fruits and trees, who gives water to the earth
where it is needed, and takes it away where too
abundant, he worships the earth." When a man tills
the earth she bestows life upon him; "as a friend to a
beloved friend, she gives him descendants and wealth."
To him who tills her, the earth says: "O man, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
tillest me with the left arm and the right, with the
right arm and the left, in love will I bear thee all
kinds of fruit." But to him who tills her not the
earth says: "Thou wilt go to the doors of others and
there stand, in order to beg for food; in idleness thou
wilt ask for it and get but little." He who sows corn,
sows purity; the law of Auramazda increases with the
fruits of the field; they extend the law of Auramazda
by 100, 1000, and 10,000 meritorious works.</p>

<p>These regulations of the Avesta were fully accepted
in the West. The great reverence paid to splendid
trees by the Ach&aelig;menids is shown by Herodotus'
story of Xerxes, that he furnished a beautiful plane
tree, which he saw in Lydia, with golden ornaments,
and appointed a perpetual guardian for it.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Ameretat,
as already observed, was the special protecting spirit
of trees (p. 164). Xenophon tells us that the Persian
kings gave special attention to agriculture; on their
journeys they inquired into the tillage of the land,
and demanded similar attention from their satraps.
Round their palaces and wherever they came they
caused the most beautiful gardens to be laid out,
planted with trees and all the most excellent shrubs in
the world.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> The satraps also had gardens of this kind
(<i>pairidaeza</i>) round their residences, and the younger
Cyrus assures Lysander, "in the name of Mithra,"
that he never took food before he had induced perspiration
by work in the garden or exercise in arms.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
The satraps, says Xenophon, whose provinces were
found deficient in population and poorly cultivated,
were punished and removed from their office, while
those whose provinces were in good order, were rewarded
by presents. When the king of the Persians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
conferred distinctions, those were summoned first who
had distinguished themselves in war, and next came
those whose districts were best cultivated.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Respect
and reverence for trees was so deeply rooted in Iran,
that even Islam did not extirpate the feeling. To this
day in Shiraz old trees are presented with dedicatory
offerings, and hung with amulets; and the pious
prefer to pray under tall trees rather than in the
neighbouring mosques; while in the barren regions of
Iran even groups of bushes receive offerings.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Besides the care of trees, plants, and the soil, the
labour of mankind must be directed to the care of the
flocks, to the increase of the animals of the good god,
and the destruction of the Khraf&ccedil;tras, or animals
belonging to the evil spirit (p. 171). Cows are not
held in such veneration in Iran as beyond the Indus,
yet even here the "cow is not to be driven on the
wrong way," and gomez (the urine of oxen) is the
most effectual means of purification; in the theory
of the priests Auramazda began the creation of living
things with the bull. We have already mentioned
the rank taken among the animals of Auramazda by
the cock and dog. In the Vendidad Auramazda
says: "I have created the dog with clothes and shoes
of his own, with keen scent and sharp teeth, attached
to men, savage against the enemy, for the protection
of the flocks. No thief or wolf comes to the village
or the fold and carries away anything unobserved, if
the dog is healthy, in good voice, and among the
flocks. The houses would not stand firm upon the
earth if there were not dogs in the villages and flocks.
The dog is patient, contented, and satisfied with little
food, like a priest; he goes forward, and is before and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
behind the house, like a warrior; he sleeps less than
the husbandmen, is talkative like a child, and friendly
as a mistress."<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> The dogs are to receive good food,
"for of all the creatures of Auramazda old age comes
upon them the most quickly;" especially must the
watch-dog be provided with milk, fat, and flesh,
"the proper food" for a dog; and a dog must never
be among those who are eating without receiving
something to eat. Any one who gives unbroken
bones or hot food to a sheep-dog or house-dog, and
the bones injure him, and the hot food burns his
mouth and tongue, so that he dies&mdash;is worthy of
death.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Dogs with young are treated with the same
care as pregnant women. It is a sin to chase or beat
a dog which has brought forth; if she is injured or
dies in running the sinner is worthy of death; and
any one who beats a pregnant dog is to receive twice
seven hundred stripes. It is the duty of every
man to bring up for six months the dogs born on
his ground, until they are able to run round in a
circuit of twice seven houses.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Sick dogs are treated
with the same remedies as rich men; and to the
question of Zarathrustra&mdash;"If the dog will not take
the remedies?" Auramazda answers that in this case
"the dog can be tied, and its mouth opened with a
flat piece of wood."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Wounds inflicted on dogs are to
be punished with stripes to the number of twice eight
hundred;<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> and besides this, compensation is to be given
for the damage which thieves or wolves do to the
village so long as the dog is prevented by his injuries
from keeping watch. The book of the law everywhere
threatens all those men who beat dogs that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
their souls will go from this world full of terror, and
sick. To kill a water-dog is the greatest crime;<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
and is menaced with the worst penalties and expiations
known to the Vendidad. As a general rule
punishments do not go beyond 2000 stripes, or the
necessity of killing 2000 noxious animals; but the
slayer of the water-dog is to receive 10,000 stripes.
Besides this, if he would save his soul, he must give
10,000 parcels of hard wood, well hewn and dried,
for the fire of Auramazda, and also 10,000 parcels of
soft, fragrant wood; he must kill 10,000 snakes, and
an equal number of tortoises, lizards, and water-lizards,
ants, flies, and rats. He must fill up 10,000 impure
holes in the earth; give to the priests all the utensils
required for the holy rites; to a warrior a complete
set of armour; to a husbandman he must give all that
is needed for agriculture: a house, provided with
a beautiful mat, and arable land for tillage. In
addition, he must give, as an expiation for his soul,
fourteen head of small cattle to the "pure men," and
bring up fourteen young dogs, and build fourteen
bridges over running water. He must cleanse eighteen
dogs from fleas, and make eighteen bones into edible
food; and satisfy eighteen "pure men" with wine
and flesh. If he does not perform these expiations he
will go into the dwelling of the Druj, and "the heat
which is injurious to the pasture will not depart from
his dwelling until he has offered sacrifice for three
days and nights for the pure soul of the water-dog,
on the burning fire, with bound rods and uplifted
Haoma."<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>In order to extirpate the animals of Angromainyu,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the priest is to be provided with a stick, the Khraf&ccedil;tra-killer.
Herodotus has already told us, that the Magians
held it a duty to kill serpents, ants, and other creeping
and winged insects. For the expiation of sins
the Avesta universally requires the killing of serpents,
lizards, and ants; rats and mice, which do harm to
the crops; flies, midges, fleas, lice, and other vermin.
Plutarch tells us that the Persians count him a happy
man who slays most water-mice; Agathias observes
that in honour of the chief festival in Persia every
one killed as many snakes, and beasts of prey, and
animals living in the desert, as possible, and then
brought them to the Magians as a proof of his piety.
In this way they believed that they did what was
pleasing to the good god, while they injured and
distressed Arimanes.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>According to the Avesta, the soul of man is kept
pure by truthfulness, industry, and diligence, by good
thoughts, good words and acts, which advance the
kingdom of life; the body is to be kept free from dirt
and the house from filth and dead creatures; from all
that belongs to the evil spirits and is in their power.
The soul of man is created pure; but from the first
the body has certain impure parts, and the defilement
which Angromainyu brought into the bodies of men.
This defilement consists in the spittle, the excrements,
dead skin, sores, etc; in everything that has an unpleasant
smell, or is removed from the living body,
like the hair and nails. These when cut are dead,
and therefore belong to the kingdom of darkness;
hence in Iran as in India they are impure things.
"Wherever cut hair and nails lie," says the book of
the law, "there the Daevas gather to these unholy
places; there the impure animals come, which men call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
lice. Therefore carry away&mdash;so saith Auramazda&mdash;cut
hair and nails, ten paces from the pure men, twenty
from the fire, thirty from the water, fifty from the
sacred bundle of rods. Dig a hole below the house in
the earth, pronounce the prayer Ahunavairya thrice,
six times, nine times, and then say: To thee, O bird,
Asho-zusta, I show these nails. These nails I dedicate
to thee; may they be thy lances, thy swords, thy bow,
thy swift-flying arrows, thy sling-stones against the
Mazanian Daevas. If these nails are not announced to
the bird Asho-zusta, they are weapons for, not against,
the Daevas."<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Spittle is among the worst impurities.
The priests could only approach the fire with veiled
mouth, and even now the Parsees invariably cover the
mouth in praying. They eat in silence, and two
never use the same spoon, because the food would
then be polluted by spittle. The removal of the excrements
requires as much care in the Avesta as it did
in the Brahmanic law, and the Vendidad gives minute
regulations in regard to these matters.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> A man is
rendered impure by excess and debauchery; a woman
by her courses, "by marks and blood," and by the
birth of a child. She must be carried to an elevated
place in the dwelling, which is strewn with dry sand,
fifteen paces from the fire, from water, and the sacred
bundle of rods, "at a distance also from the trees," and
so placed that she cannot see the fire on the hearth.
No one may touch her. Only a definite amount
of certain kinds of food can be given to her, and that
in metal jars, because these contract the least amount
of impurity, and are most easily cleansed; the person
who brings the food must remain three paces distant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
from her bed. After childbirth a woman is unclean
for three days; then she must wash her body with
water and gomez. If she has had a miscarriage her
body is also polluted by the dead child: she must be
placed thirty paces away from the fire and the sacred
objects of the house, and must pass a longer period on
her dust-bed&mdash;at the present time forty-one days are
required. The first thing she is allowed to taste is
ashes mixed with gomez&mdash;three, six, and then nine
drops. The nine apertures of her body&mdash;that number
is common to the Indians and Iranians&mdash;must be
washed with ashes and gomez. She may not drink
any water out of her impure hand; if she does so, she
must receive two hundred blows with the rod, and
two hundred with the whip.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Fire and water, springs,
streams and rivers, the best gifts of the good gods,
must, like the human body, be carefully preserved
from all filth and defilement. The accounts of Western
writers prove that the Persians and Medes observed
the rules of purification given in the Book of the Law;
it was not the custom among the Persians to spit in
the presence of another, still less to sneeze, etc. They
avoided the defilement of a river, or of the shadow of
a man; and it was forbidden to uncover in the sight
of the sun or moon.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>"The sun, the moon, the stars shine unwillingly,"
we are told in the Vendidad, "on the polluted man."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
"The impure takes away prosperity and increase; he
brings sickness and death; after death he will not go
into heaven."<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> "But whatever pollution a man has
contracted, and whatever sin he has committed, the
good law quenches all impurity and sin, if the purifi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>cations,
expiations, and penalties which it prescribes are
performed and paid; for the good law of Auramazda
surpasses all others in greatness, goodness, and salvation,
as far as the heaven rises above the earth, and
as the sea of Vourukasha includes all other waters."<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
"The good law of Auramazda takes from the man who
praises it and commits no evil actions afterwards, his
deception; it takes away the murder of the pure man,
and the burial of the dead; it takes away inexpiable
actions, and accumulated guilt; it takes away all evil
words, thoughts, and actions, even as the strong swift
wind purifies heaven from the right side."<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>Slight pollution is removed by washing with pure
water accompanied by certain prayers and imprecations
on the Daevas, such as: "I contend with thee,
O evil Angromainyu; away from this dwelling, away
from the fire, the water, from this place, from all the
blessings which Auramazda has created. I contend
against pollution, direct and indirect; against the
unclean spirits; I contend against the Daeva Andra,
&Ccedil;aurva, Zairicha (p. 169); against the Pairika, who
goes to the water, the earth, cattle, and trees," etc.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
More serious impurities require ablutions with gomez,
which in certain cases have to be repeated thirty
times, with various prayers.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The most efficacious
purification, which removes even the worst taint, is
that of the nine nights. This can only be performed
by a priest, who knows the law accurately, can repeat
the sacred word by heart, and speaks the truth. A
special place must be constructed for it; thirty paces
(which are equal to ninety times the length of the
foot) from the fire, the water, and the sacred bundle
of rods. In the middle of this space nine pits are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
dug in the earth, and round them twelve furrows are
drawn with a metal instrument. The purifier sprinkles
the person who requires cleansing (who is entirely
naked) with gomez, from a leaden vessel, with many
prayers. He is then rubbed fifteen times with earth;
he must then wash himself at each of the nine pits
once, twice, thrice with water, after which he is fumigated
with fragrant wood. Then follow washings with
water and gomez in the third, sixth, and ninth night.
"After this," says the book, "the purified person shall
bring water of purification to the fire, hard wood, and
perfumes; he is to utter praises to Auramazda, to the
Amesha &Ccedil;pentas, and to the rest of the pure ones&mdash;so
will the man be purified." The purifier must be
rewarded for this purification; according to the measure
of the man's property the payment rises from
small cattle and cows to camels; "in order that the
purifier may go away contented and without hatred."
Instead of cattle, goods of another description can be
given. "But if the purifier goes away discontented,
the wicked spirit of impurity comes again into the
purified persons, and they are impure for evermore."<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>In the view of the Avesta impurity consists essentially
in that which is opposed to life; hence there is
no worse form of uncleanness than that caused by the
corpse. The body, as soon as the soul has left it,
belongs to Angromainyu. The fiend of death, the
Druj Na&ccedil;u, obtains possession of it, and from it she
springs on all who touch it, or come near it. If a
man dies, or a dog&mdash;and in this matter dogs are put
quite on a level with men&mdash;and other men and women
are in the same house&mdash;two, five, fifty, or a hundred&mdash;the
Druj Na&ccedil;u comes immediately from the north
in the form of a fly, and settles on all the inhabitants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
of the house and makes them impure with infection,
pollution, and uncleanness.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> In the first instance she
is to be met by incantations&mdash;the Gathas, Bisamruta,
Thrisamruta, Chathrasamruta, must be repeated; then
the fiend falls to pieces like grass that has been
dead a year.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> After this the hearth-fire must be
removed from the house of the dead, and the sacred
utensils&mdash;the mortar, the cup, the sacred bundle of
rods, and the Haoma. In winter the fire can be
kindled again upon the hearth after nine nights; in
summer, when the need for warmth and cooked food
is less pressing, after a month; any one who does not
observe these periods is to be punished with twice two
hundred stripes.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> After purification the kinsmen are
to utter prayers for the departed, and the number of
these is fixed, in the Vendidad, in the same fanciful
manner which is so often met with in the book of
Manu. The number decreases according to the degree
of relationship; for the nearest kinsmen thirty prayers
are spoken; for the most remote, five; if the dead
man has led an impure life the number of prayers is
doubled in order to give efficacy to the petition.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>The preservation and increase of life is the foundation
of the teaching of the Avesta. The good life of
nature is promoted by planting and agriculture, by
tending the useful and destroying the pernicious
animals; and by posterity provision is to be made for
the life of men. From this point of view the Vendidad
lays especial weight on marriage. "I declare," Auramazda
says, "that the married is before the unmarried,
and he that has a house before him that has
none, and the father of children before the childless."<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
We can only ascertain very incompletely from the
remaining fragments of the Avesta the rules which
it prescribed for family life. We see that bringing
about a marriage was regarded as a meritorious work,
and marriage between close relations was considered
happy. Yet maidens are not to be given in marriage
before their fifteenth year.<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> To those who have long
remained unmarried the god Haoma, the special protector
of life, sends truthful, active husbands, gifted
with good understanding (p. 125). We never hear of
any difference of the orders in contracting marriage;
nor is there the least hint that the priest can only
marry a wife of priestly blood, or the husbandman
a wife of his own class. On the other hand, the strictest
directions are given that the worshippers of
Auramazda are only to marry among themselves;
marriage with those of an alien religion is severely
reprobated. "A man who mingles the seed of the
faithful and the unbelievers, the seed of the worshippers
of the Daevas with the worshippers of Mazda,
keeps back a third part of the flowing water, a third
part of the increase of the blooming plants, and their
golden fruits; he annihilates a third part of the
clothing of &Ccedil;penta Armaiti (the Earth); he robs the
just men of a third part of their power, their merits,
their purity. They who do this are more destructive
than forked serpents, than howling wolves, than the
she-wolf which rushes on the flocks, than the thousand-fold
brood of the lizard, which pollutes the
water."<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> The Vendidad gives the house-father a
similar power over his wife and children to that given
in Manu's law&mdash;so far as we can conclude from
certain indications. He is to be spoken of with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
same reverence as the house-father on the Ganges;
the wife is to be honoured, but is to "be watched
perpetually, like the fire of Auramazda."<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> With
regard to the education of children, we can only
gather from the Vendidad they were to be tended for
seven years; "protect dogs for six months, children
for seven years;"<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> and boys are to be invested in their
fifteenth year with the sacred girdle.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> We remember
the sacred girdle which the three upper castes wore
and still wear beyond the Ganges; the investiture
with this, and adoption into the family and caste&mdash;"the
second birth" takes place, according to Manu's
law, among the Brahman boys in the eighth year,
among the Kshatryas, in the eleventh, and the Vai&ccedil;yas
in the twelfth. The habit of wearing the girdle,
which prevails on both sides of the Indus, proves that
this custom was in use before the two branches of the
Arians separated. Originally the girdle was intended
to be a protection or amulet against the evil spirits.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
In the girdle which the priests prepare with traditional
ceremonies, and put on boys in their seventh or tenth
year, the modern Parsees see the bond which encloses
and unites the worshippers of Auramazda.</p>

<p>If I attempt to supplement the scanty hints of the
Avesta on family life from the accounts preserved to us
on this subject by Western writers, it must be remembered
that the more ancient of these statements hold
good only of the West of Iran. But as we have
hitherto found the worship and manners of the Persians
and Medes, as described by the Greeks, agreeing with
the rules of the Avesta, we may suppose that in this
province also East and West were in agreement.
Herodotus states that the Persians married many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
wives, and had concubines in addition. They considered
it honourable and right to have as many
children as possible; next to bravery in war it was the
greatest merit to have many children, and the king
sent presents every year to the man who had most.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
Of all days the Persians celebrated most the day
on which they were born. A more abundant meal
was served on this day: among the wealthy an ox,
a horse, or a camel was roasted whole; and smaller
animals among those who were poorer. Plato adds:
"When the first son, the heir of the kingdom, was
born to the king of Persia, all the subjects of the king
celebrated the day, and on the birthday of the king
there were festivals and sacrifices throughout all
Asia."<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> Herodotus observes, that the respect of children
for their parents was great. The Persians
regarded the murder of parents by a son as impossible;
if such a thing happened they believed that the
child was supposititious.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Aristotle tells us that the
power of the father over the sons among the Persians
was tyrannical, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> unlimited; he treated them as
slaves.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> That the mother was also treated with
respect follows from the statement that the son
might not remain seated when the mother entered,
and could only resume his seat at her permission.
At the court of the Ach&aelig;menids the mother of the
king had the first place, the king the second.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> That
the queen-mother often exercised great influence is
shown by the history of this ruling family. Of the
careful education of the heir to the throne, the other
princes, and the sons of the wealthy Persians, both
in the exercise and strengthening of their bodies and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
in moral training, the Western writers had much
to tell.</p>

<p>What the Greeks narrate respecting the celebration
of the birthday among the Persians, the distinction of
the satraps whose provinces were best cultivated and
populated, and the rewards given to those who had
most children, agrees entirely with the delight in life
which runs through the Avesta, and the exhortations
to increase life everywhere present in that book.
The Avesta always speaks of one wife only. The
polygamy noticed by the Greeks was limited to the
rich (the number of wives among the Persians, says
Ammian, was regulated by property<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>); in consequence
of the religious feeling just noticed, it prevailed, no
doubt, far more extensively among the Arians of Iran
than among the Indians. Yet the harems of the
Indian princes were large. However numerous the
harems of the Ach&aelig;menids, only one wife was the
lawful wife; and she alone, as in India, bore the name
of queen: only her sons could be considered heirs to
the throne. The other wives greeted the queen on
their knees: the queen must belong to the race of the
Ach&aelig;menids, or at any rate to one of the six tribal
princes.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> The same was the case among the rest of
the Persians who had several wives; one only was the
house-wife. The Avesta told us above that the wife
must be watched. According to Plutarch the Persians
were more strict in this matter than the rest of the
barbarians; they kept not only the wife but the concubines
shut up, and they left the houses in covered
cars only.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Manu's law also requires that women
should be watched (IV. 263). The power of the father,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and the respectful attitude of the children to the
mother, correspond to the principles of family life
which we have seen beyond the Indus. Yet, so far as
we can see, marriage was not in Iran so close and
firmly established a relation as among the Arians of
India, where the wife belonged absolutely to the man,
and surrendered herself in complete devotion to him;
nor did the relation of children to parents in Iran experience
that excellent and happy development which
on the whole attended it in India, and of which we can
still perceive the results. If Western writers maintain
that it was the custom among the Persians to take the
nearest relations in marriage, so that even the brother
married the sister (of which Herodotus gives an
example in Cambyses) and the son the mother after
the father's death (the latter is said to have prevailed
especially among the Magi)<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>&mdash;the Avesta, as we have
seen, declared marriages between near relations to be
good, and the history of the Ach&aelig;menids mentions
marriage with sisters more than once. The more
extreme assertions, especially in regard to the Magi,
are to be regarded as exaggerations of the Greeks, and
owed their origin to their astonishment at a custom
which was more than revolting. On the relation of
the sexes both before and after marriage, and other
matters connected with procreation, the Vendidad
supplies a number of minute regulations.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>The preservation of life also receives great attention
in the Avesta. We remember the incantations of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Rigveda which banish sickness into thrushes and woodpeckers,
and the sentences of the Atharvaveda against
sickness and death (IV. 281). The remedies of the Veda
are water and plants. All remedies are in water;
the waters of the springs and the waters of the rivers
drive away sickness. The plants said, when they came
from heaven, that they descended from the water of
the sky. "The mortal whom we touch will suffer no
harm." "May Agni protect me with the waters, and
Soma with the plants," we are told in the Veda; and
again: "The plants whose king is Soma, have rescued
me from death."<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> The priest who knows the sentences
is at the same time the physician, though the Rigveda
has a separate name for the latter (IV. 35). How
highly the Indians respected doctors and physicians
at a later time, in spite of the theory of the Brahmans
of the unworthiness of the body, and how it was the
custom there in the sixth century <small>B.C.</small> to send for the
physician in every sickness, has been mentioned in its
place (IV. 323). Proceeding from precisely the same
conceptions, the Avesta went on to fill several books
with medical remedies. The best mode of healing
is that by charms, and the sacred word. In such
incantations of the Avesta we are told: "I contend
against sickness, I contend against death, I contend
against pain, I contend against fever, I contend against
the corruption and pollution which Angromainyu has
created in the body of men. Sickness, I curse thee;
fever, I curse thee; death, I curse thee."<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The sacred
word is invoked to heal by its power. "Mayst thou
heal me, O Manthra &Ccedil;penta. As a recompense I will
give to thee a thousand stall-fed oxen, a thousand
spotless cattle, a thousand swiftly-running horses, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
thousand camels, swift and with strong backs. I will
bless thee with beautiful, pious blessings; with dear,
pious blessings, which make the deficient full, and the
full to overflow, which bind the friend and make the
bond firm."<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> As in the Veda, the remedies are water
and plants, "Draw up, ye clouds, draw up," we are
told in the Vendidad; "Let the water fall as thousand-fold,
ten thousand-fold rain, to drive away sickness, to
drive away corruption, to drive away death. May it
rain for the renewal of the waters, the earth, the plants,
the means of healing."<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> As in the Veda Soma is the
king of plants, so in Iran Haoma, the god of life, is
the lord of plants.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> The white heavenly Haoma grows,
as we have seen, on the Gaokerena, the tree of heaven;
from it springs the earthly Haoma and all plants of
which the seed falls from the tree Vi&ccedil;potaokhma in
Vourukasha, which the bird Chamru carries where
Tistrya collects the clouds, in order to let the seed fall
down from them to the earth.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> "I, who am the giver
of all blessings," says Auramazda, "created this dwelling
(the earth), the beautiful, brilliant, and noteworthy;
then Angromainyu, who is full of death,
created nine diseases, ninety diseases, nine hundred
diseases, nine thousand diseases, nine and ninety thousand
diseases. Thrita desired as a favour a means to
withstand death, to withstand pain, to withstand the
heat of fever, and the evil corruptions and filth which
Angromainyu has brought into the body of men.
Then I, who am Auramazda, brought forth the healing
plants, many hundreds, many thousands, many tens of
thousands, around the one Gaokerena." The invocation
then follows: "We bless thee, we invoke thee, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
worship thee for the healing of the body of men, in
order to drive away sickness, in order to drive away
death, the hot fever and the cold fever."<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>Thrita, a spirit of heaven, who has a place among
the sages and sacrificers of old time (p. 42) was, in
the Avesta, the first physician who kept back disease
and death; and every one who follows in his course,
every physician, must appear as a willing combatant,
an active co-operator against the evil spirits, from
whom death and disease proceed. According to the
Vendidad, those have the first place among the physicians
who heal by charms, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> by the sacred word,
the words of the law; these are the "physicians of
physicians;" next come the physicians who heal by
remedies; and last of all, those who heal by the knife.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>
These latter must first use the knife on the worshippers
of the Daevas; when they have done so three times,
and the patient has died each time, they are incapable
for ever of practising the art of healing. But if they
have healed three worshippers of the Daevas, they are
capable of "healing the worshippers of Auramazda, and
they can try their skill upon them as they please."
The physician is not only to heal sick men, but sick
animals also, and above all the sick dog. The Vendidad
fixes the sum which the physician is to receive
for his services. He is to heal a priest, and ask for no
more than his blessing. For healing the overseer of
a district he is to receive a yoke of four oxen, and for
his wife a she-camel; the overseer of a canton is to
pay a large beast of draught, and his wife a mare; the
head of a village pays a smaller beast, and his wife a
cow; the head of a house a small beast, and his wife a
she-ass. For healing a large beast of draught the
price is a beast of moderate size; and for one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
moderate size, a head of small cattle, etc.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Pliny quotes
a number of remedies and means of cure used by the
Magi, some of them of an extraordinary character;
indeed, the impression made on Pliny by the importance
ascribed to medicine in the doctrine of Zarathrustra
was so great, that he maintained that the
Magism of Zoroaster had arisen out of the art of
healing, and had introduced, as it were, a higher and
sacred medicine. To this was subsequently added the
power of religion, and the mathematical arts of investigating
the future by the heavens, so that Zoroaster's
doctrine had taken possession of the mind of
men by a three-fold bond.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> How greatly he is mistaken
in ascribing to the Magians the astrology of the
Chald&aelig;ans, has been remarked above; the mistake
is explained by the fact, that the Avesta includes the
astronomical knowledge of the priests of Iran in the
books which treated of medicine (p. 52).</p>

<p>The astronomical chapters are lost as well as those
on medicine. From our fragments we cannot so
much as fix the year by which the Avesta reckons.
We merely perceive that it counted by nights, not by
days. It is from the Bundehesh that we first learn
that the year of Eastern Iran is made up of 360 days
in twelve months of thirty days, with five additional
days. This year is said to have begun with the
vernal equinox, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the period when the vigour of
nature again shows itself. In the last five nights of
the old year, and the first five nights of the new one,
the spirits of the forefathers, the Fravashis, come to
their descendants in the houses; they awake with
nature to new life (p. 179). The first month is called
Farvardin after these spirits; of the remaining eleven,
six are called after the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>remaining five, which are inserted between the six,
after Mithra, Tistrya, the spirits of fire and water,
and lastly after the law (Din). The inscriptions of
the Ach&aelig;menids give us nine names of months entirely
different from these. Hence the West had its own
calendar, as well as its own alphabet, and made use of
it as early as the year 500 <small>B.C.</small> In the East the
calendar of the Avesta was in use; and this seems
to have been current in the West also in the first
half of the fourth century <small>B.C.</small> There is no doubt
whatever that it was the standard for all Iran at the
time of the Sassanids.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>We have already set forth in detail what weight
the Avesta lays on purity, and the avoidance of contact
with dead matter, which has fallen into the power
of the Daevas. From these points of view, in consequence
of the reform, the priests in Iran came to adopt
a peculiar mode of burial. Among the Arians of the
Panjab the oldest form of burial was interment, and in
time cremation came into use (IV. 62). But could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the Athravas allow anything so unclean as a corpse to
be laid on fire, the pure "son of Auramazda"? If the
corpse was thrown into water the pure water was
defiled; if buried in the earth pollution was cast
on the beautiful, submissive daughter of Auramazda.
Nothing therefore remained for the priests but to leave
the corpse above the earth; in this case it served the
pure animals, the birds and dogs, for nourishment,
and was thus destroyed in the best manner. To
throw a corpse into water, to bury or burn it, are
great sins, actions which do not admit of expiation,<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
and those who do such things "help the drought
which destroys the pasture, and the evil onsweeping
winter, which kills the flock, and is full of snow; such
men are impure for ever."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Any one who buries a
dead dog or a dead man in the earth, and does not
dig the body up again within half a year, is to receive
twice five hundred stripes; any one who allows it to
remain in the earth for a year, is to receive twice a
thousand stripes; but if a man leaves a corpse in the
earth for more than two years, there is for him neither
penalty, nor expiation, nor purification.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>The dead are to be carried away on peculiarly dry
paths, little trodden by cattle, beasts of draught, and
pure men, and laid on the driest and barest places in
the earth, on the highest eminences where carnivorous
birds and dogs may most easily see them.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> The soil
is to be dug out, waist deep, if the earth is soft; if
hard, to the depth of half a foot, and this depression
is to be filled with tiles, stones, and dust; for damp
earth contracts pollution most readily, whereas stones,
tiles, and dust contract it very slowly. To this place
(Dakhma) the naked corpse is to be taken on a bier,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
which has a foundation of stones or tiles, by two strong
men&mdash;never by one: one bearer would pollute himself
for ever, and the Druj Na&ccedil;u would never leave him.
Any one who throws a cloth on the dead must be
punished with twice four hundred, or twice a thousand
stripes, according to the size of the cloth. The corpse
is to be placed on the Dakhma, with the face turned
to the sun (any one who does not place the body with
its face to the sun, is to pay the same penalty as is
prescribed for the murder of a pure man<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>): the corpse
is then to be secured in its place by iron, stones, or
lead, attached to the feet or hair, in order that the
birds and dogs may not carry away the bones and
remains to water and trees: the neglect of these
fastenings is to be punished with twice two hundred
stripes.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> If it rains or snows, or the wind is strong, so
that the necessary preparations cannot be made on
the day of death, the corpse can be carried on its own
bed and mat to the Dakhma.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>At these burial-places the Daevas hold their meetings;
there they propagate and assemble, "in order
to bring to death, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, ten
thousand, an innumerable host of men;" there the
Daevas are most dangerous and deadly to men: for
in the places of burial are "infection, disease, fever,
impurity, ague, trembling, and old hair." A Dakhma
is not pure till the body has been eaten by dogs and
birds, till the remains have entirely changed into dust,
and become utterly mixed up with the foundation of
mortar, tiles, and stones. When this point has been
reached, the Dakhma should be levelled. Such destruction
of the place of burial is regarded by the law-book
as the annihilation of death itself; as one of the
highest virtues of the faithful. "He who levels only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
so much as the size of his own body of a burial-place,"
says the book of the law, "has repented of all his
sins which he has committed in thought, speech, and
action; he has not only repented of them, but he has
expiated them, and the two heavenly powers will not
begin a contest about his entrance into paradise."<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>The prescriptions of the law for the purification of
the vessels and clothes which have touched the corpse,
are given from regard to utility, and from the point of
view of a certain simple rationalism, which forms an
advantageous contrast between Iran and India. Vessels
of lead, wood, and earth, are impure for ever; vessels
of gold and silver can be taken into use again after a
number of washings with gomez. Garments on which
spittle, moisture, or dung have fallen are to be cut in
pieces and buried; in other cases they can be purified
with gomez, water, and earth, and aired, and then
again taken into use for women at the time of impurity.
The house of the dead is pure when the
period for the extinction of the fire is over, when
the prayers appointed for the dead have been said,
and the inhabitants of the house have had their
bodies and clothes washed three times, and the sacred
hymns have been sung (p. 215).</p>

<p>For the bearers, who have carried a corpse to the
Dakhma, and those who in any way have come into
contact with a corpse, special forms of purification are
necessary. The washing of the bearers must be begun
immediately after the corpse has been deposited. For
this purpose the gomez of the nearest male and female
relation of the dead is required as well as that of
"cattle and beasts of draught." At the last washing
the Druj Na&ccedil;u springs out of the forehead between
the eyebrows, from thence to the shoulders and under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the arms, until at length by continued ablutions she
is driven into the left toes, and is compelled to pass
away from there to the north in the form of a fly.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
In order to purify the way on which the dead has
been carried to the Dakhma, a dog must be led along
it, three times, six times, and nine times. Then a
priest must walk along it, who pronounces the "victorious
words," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> certain exorcisms. "I drive
back the Daevi Druj, so that she flies to the North.
Avaunt! She must not slay the corporeal world of
the pure. May Auramazda and &Ccedil;penta Armaiti protect
us from our enemies; may &Ccedil;raosha come, and Vohumano."<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>
The worst of all forms of pollution is that
contracted by touching a corpse in a distant place in
solitude, for here the power of the demon was greatest.
Any one to whom this has happened, is to wash himself
fifteen times with water, and rub himself an equal
number of times with earth, to hurry away from the
spot, and call out to every one whom he meets: "I
have touched a dead body, without wishing it in
thought, word, or deed; my desire is purification."
Every one is to avoid him unless he wishes to bring
on himself the guilt of the impure man.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>Pools and streams are polluted by corpses till the
corpses have been removed and rain has thrice fallen
upon the water; after this cattle and men can again
drink of the water. So long as the corpse lies in a
river, the fiend of death extends over nine paces
above and three paces below it, and six paces on
either side; in a pool the domain of the fiend is six
paces in every direction; in snow and ice-water it is
three paces. When Zarathrustra asks, whether the
water which falls from heaven on the corpse is impure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
the god answers, "I, Auramazda, allow the water to
go forth from Lake Vourukasha, with storms and
clouds, and to fall on a corpse; I, Auramazda, and to
flow upon a burial-place, and upon a dung-heap, and
carry away a bone, and wash all into Lake Puitika (the
pool of purification in heaven). When purified the
waters flow from Lake Puitika into Lake Vourukasha.
I, Auramazda, rain down herbs of all kinds, to be
food for the pious men, food for the useful cattle.
With such speeches Auramazda appeased the just
Zarathrustra."<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Zarathrustra further inquires, whether
corpses which have been carried by dogs, wolves, and
panthers to a field make the field and men impure?
Auramazda, as frequently happens in such cases,
argues from the point of view of the possible and
attainable. "If such corpses," says the god, "rendered
men impure, all mankind would quickly be rendered
impure owing to the multitude of the corpses which
are upon the earth." But Zarathrustra is not satisfied;
he says: "A man dies in the hollow of a valley; from
the heights of the mountains a bird flies down to the
valley, and then back to the summit of a mountain,
and alights on a tree of hard or soft wood. There he
is sick and voids excrements. Then a man goes up
from the valley to the summit of the mountain, and
comes to the tree, on which the bird has sat, and seeks
fuel for his fire. He cuts the tree down, splits it up,
and kindles a fire with it. What is his penalty?"
Auramazda again replies that nothing carried away
by wolves, dogs, birds, flies, or winds pollutes men.
But now it occurs to Zarathrustra, or rather to the
priests who have written these things down, whether
the animals which have eaten the corpses are not
impure. This difficulty Auramazda solves by declar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>ing
the animals pure; but no flesh of such animals is
to be eaten within a year, or offered for sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>With the exception of Herodotus, Strabo, and
Agathias, the Western writers give us only very exaggerated
accounts of the peculiar mode of burial in use
among the Persians. Herodotus has already told us
that the corpses of the Magians were exposed to dogs
and birds; with regard to the corpses of the rest he
had no accurate knowledge, for a mystery was made of
the matter.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Onesicritus relates that those Bactrians,
who were weakened by disease and age, were thrown to
dogs brought up for the purpose and called buriers of
the dead; and Strabo says that among the Caspians,
parents, when they had reached seventy years of age,
were shut up by their children, and so killed by starvation;<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
though he also observes that the Magians
gave over the corpses to birds.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Cicero narrates that
it was not the custom of the Magians to bury the
corpses of their dead before they had been torn by
wild animals: in Hyrcania a peculiar kind of dog
was reared&mdash;by the lower classes in common; of the
wealthier men each had his own&mdash;by which they
might be torn after death, and this was considered
the best kind of burial.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> From Eusebius we hear
that the Medes gave the dying to carefully-reared
dogs; the Hyrcanians and Caspians those who were
still alive; the Bactrians the old; others the dead.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
Agathias, on the other hand, tells us, that the dead
among the Persians were carried out before the
gates of the cities naked and without a coffin, and
eaten by dogs, so that the bones lay about in the
fields. If any man's corpse was not at once eaten, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Persians believed that he had been of an unholy mind,
that his soul was unjust and wicked, and so had
come into the power of the evil spirits, and would be
carried into hell. Such men were lamented by their
friends, because they had no part in the better lot.
Those who were most quickly eaten up, the Persians
praised as fortunate; they called their souls the best,
and like the gods, and said of them that they had
gone into the good land.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>The Greeks maintained that the Ach&aelig;menids were
buried at Pasargadae and Persepolis, and that the
corpse of Cyrus rested at Pasargadae.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Of Darius
we are told that even in his lifetime he caused his
tomb to be prepared on the summit of a mountain.
The corpses of Artaxerxes I. of Damaspia, and of
his son Xerxes, were buried, according to Ctesias, in
Persia.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> The last Darius was buried by Alexander in
the royal sepulchre, when he had already given the
honours of burial to the Persian queen Statera.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> Diodorus
tells us that these tombs were on the eastern
side of the citadel of Persepolis, at a distance of four
hundred feet, in the "royal mountain." The rock
was hewn out, and contained several chambers. But
these tombs had no entrance; the corpses were drawn
up by machines to the summit, and so laid in them.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>The burial-places of the rulers of ancient Persia can
still be recognised. Some hundred paces to the east
of the remains of the royal palace at Persepolis, towards
the rising of the sun, precisely as Diodorus
describes the place, are three stone pictures in Mount
Rachmed. Sculptures which begin three hundred feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
above the ground on the perpendicular front of the
mountain form three high fa&ccedil;ades, with pillars, which
present a gateway with woodwork, supporting a large
canopy, on which are seen several rows of dogs; the
same animals are to be seen on the lower lines of
ornamentation. Within this framework are the pictures
of the buried sovereigns. In the left hand is the bow
without a string; the right is raised in an attitude of
prayer, and the figures are standing before an altar of
burning fire. The king is supported on a foundation
upheld by the arms of several rows of men, who represent
the conquered lands. Two leagues to the north of
Persepolis are four great sculptures, now called Naksh-i-Rustem,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> pictures of Rustem, of a similar kind, but
beginning only sixty or seventy feet from the ground,
deeply cut in the perpendicular wall of two hundred
feet in length. Three of these pictures are close together;
the fourth is on a spur of the rock, at right
angles to the other three. The centre of the three
marks the tomb of Darius, the son of Hystaspes. It
is the only one among the seven monuments which
has inscriptions.</p>

<p>The corpses of the princes might have been exposed
to the sun, the dogs, and birds on the summit above
these pictures. In that case they would merely mark
the place of exposure, and these rocks would be burial-places
like those of the modern Parsees in Bombay.
But behind the sculptures, though not accessible from
them, sepulchral chambers have been discovered. From
this, and from the description which the Greeks give
us of the tomb of Cyrus, we must draw the conclusion
that the Persian custom of burial did not agree with
the rule of the Avesta&mdash;with the exception of the
priests, whose corpses, as Herodotus expressly states,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
were exposed. The Vendidad laments that in certain
districts of the East, Arachosia and Chakhra, the dead
were burned, or buried.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> Under the Sassanids exposure
was strictly observed both in the East and
West, as is clear from the account of Agathias already
quoted, and all the statements which relate to this
later period.</p>

<p>The regulations of the book of the law with regard
to the burial of corpses and the places of exposure are
still strictly observed by the Parsees. Great care is
taken at the erection of a Dakhma that the rain-water
can run off from the bier of the corpse. At the last
moment a dog is brought into the presence of the
dying person, so that its eye may be directed on him;
and when a woman with child dies two dogs are
brought, because two lives are in question. The eye
of the dog has the power to keep the evil spirits at a
distance. But every one must remain at nine paces
distance from the dying person. After death the two
corpse-bearers at once strip the body&mdash;their hands are
protected from immediate contact by napkins made of
old clothes&mdash;and carry it on a bier of iron&mdash;for metal
contracts less pollution than wood&mdash;accompanied by
the prayers of the priests, to the place of burial. The
kinspeople follow the corpse in silence to within ninety
paces of the Dakhma. For the first three nights the
priests and kinsmen repeat continually the prescribed
prayers for the soul of the dead; in the third night
the decision is made at the bridge of Chinvat (p. 178).
The burial-places of the Parsees at Bombay are
situated on a mountain on the coast, on the summit of
which several hollows have been cut. From a distance
the relatives look eagerly to this summit, to see
whether the vultures are already attacking the corpse,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
and which part of it they first consume. For the first
year after death a prayer is said daily before meals for
the soul of the dead to the Fravashis of the pure,<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> and
a service is held on the day of the month on which the
death took place. In the years that follow, on the
fourth, tenth, and thirtieth day of each month, as the
book prescribes, but above all on the festival of all
souls&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> on the feast of the ten nights during which
the Fravashis come down (p. 224)&mdash;prayers are said
for the dead.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to ascertain the arrangement
and life of the state from the very scanty and obscure
traits in the existing fragments of the law. We have
no rules on the rights and duties of the monarchy,
though these were included in the Avesta, if we may
trust the list of contents.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> But the splendour of majesty
as it dwelt with the rulers of old time, with Yima,
Thraetaona, and Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa, and was imparted to
&Ccedil;yavarshana and Vista&ccedil;pa, is brought strongly into prominence;
and among the Amesha &Ccedil;pentas we found
the spirit of good order, of good government. Of the
position of the orders so much only is clear&mdash;that the
priests claimed precedence over the warriors and husbandmen;
that the Avesta allows them certain privileges
of moderate extent (p. 187); and that the priestly
families did not form exclusive castes, though the
priestly functions were hereditary in them. Still less
can we learn of the families of the warriors. We do
not hear that they enjoyed a favoured position; they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
are merely mentioned before the husbandmen; and
the Vendidad also gives us some information about
their armour. It should consist of a coat of mail and
helmet, a girdle and greaves, a bow with thirty arrows, a
sling with thirty stones, a sword, a club, and a lance.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
Under the Ach&aelig;menids there were rich families in
Bactria and Sogdiana, in which we may no doubt
venture to find descendants of the old military families,
enjoying an influential position in politics; under
the Sassanids the knightly nobility of Iran comes
plainly to the front. The Avesta speaks of great and
intermediate houses, of important and unimportant
inhabitants of the villages. We also read of rich and
poor, men who have property and beggars; and mention
is made of tradespeople and slaves. The Avesta
rises from the lord of the house to the lord of the
village or community (<i>vi&ccedil;</i>), then to the lord of the
tribe or canton (<i>zantu</i>) and to the lord of the province
(<i>danhu</i>); an arrangement which corresponds to
the Indian government as fixed by Manu's regulations.
When Alexander of Macedon forced his way
to Bactria and Sogdiana, he met with resistance from
the native overseers of cantons or chieftains, whom he
had summoned to Zariaspa, "the largest city" in
Bactria (p. 12).<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> When the castles of the most
powerful had been taken, and their lords had submitted,
he sought to gain them by marrying their
daughters to the captains of his army, while he
himself took to wife the daughter of the Bactrian
Oxyartes.</p>

<p>The protection of property is obviously a matter
of great importance in the Avesta. The utility of
dogs is frequently mentioned, which protect flocks and
villages from thieves and wolves. Theft is looked on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
as especially wicked, because the thief leads a roving
life, eats raw and unprepared food, and carries on his
evil work in the darkness.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> In regard to contracts the
Vendidad distinguishes six kinds, according as they
are concluded by word, by the pledge of hands, and
are concerned with the value of a head of small cattle,
a beast of draught, a man (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a slave), and a piece of
land. Anyone who violates the first kind is to receive
300 blows with the rod, and 300 with the whip, and
the punishment increases in the violation of the other
kinds up to 1000 stripes with both instruments.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> To
check injury of the person the Vendidad lays down
the rule, that anyone who lifts up his weapon against
a man without beating him, is to receive twice five
stripes the first time, and twice two hundred on the
seventh occasion of committing the offence, if he has
not expiated the preceding six offences; if he has expiated
them, the measure of the first offence is dealt
out on each occasion. Anyone who attacks another
not in anger but with malice, is to be punished with
twice fifteen, and on the sixth occasion with 200
stripes, in case he has not expiated the former offences.
Anyone who inflicts a wound on another, is punished
the first time with twice thirty, the fifth time with
twice two hundred stripes. The same punishment is
inflicted on a man who breaks the bones of another, if
he does not expiate the offence. If the wound proves
fatal, he is to be punished with twice ninety stripes,
and on a second offence with twice two hundred.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>We have but few indications in the Avesta from
which to draw conclusions as to the state of civilisation.
The amounts to be paid to the purifier and the
physician are given in animals; the series of contracts
is determined according to the value of small
cattle, beasts of draught, slaves, and landed property.
But other property may be given in place of the
animals; we find mention of money (<i>shaeta</i>),<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> and, as
has been observed, of tradespeople; of mats and
carpets, vessels of earth, silver, and gold, rich garments,
palaces with pillars and turrets, ovens for smelting and
for glass. The art of the physician cannot have been
in a primitive stage, when so much space is devoted to
remedies (p. 223), and the physicians who heal with
the knife are designated as a separate class. So far as
I can see, the Avesta betrays a state of civilisation,
which, beginning from the pastoral condition, has
remained in close connection with cattle-breeding and
agriculture, but has also reached a more advanced
stage. The unions of the tribes seem dissolved, and
neither the previous importance of the warlike families
nor their present position is brought prominently
forward. This, no less than the liberal imposition
of bodily punishment, shows that long before the
dominion of the Ach&aelig;menids, the East of Iran must
have been in the hands of princes who ruled with
despotic power.</p>

S&auml;chsischen Gesellschaft der Wiss." 1862) places the establishment of
the cycle, by which, in order to bring the year of 365 days into
agreement with the natural time, a month was inserted every 120
years, and consequently the introduction of the East Iranian calendar
into the whole kingdom, in the year 411, or between 428 and 381
<small>B.C.</small> That the beginning of the year was universally placed in the
spring after the introduction of this calendar, and fixed between
March and the middle of June, would follow from the importance
of the Farvardin festival, even if it were not sufficiently vouched
for by other evidence. The Bundehesh (c. 25) speaks of the year as
fixed, inasmuch as it reckons the shortening of the days from a certain
day in the month of Tir, and puts the shortest day on the 20th of the
month of Din, yet it adds that the priests reckoned on this basis, and
that the lunar year did not correspond to the year thus calculated.
The Cappadocian names for the months are those of the East Iranian
calendar; and the Cappadocians cannot have obtained these till
the calendar was current throughout the whole kingdom of the
Ach&aelig;menids. On this ground also Von Gutschmid's dates do not
seem to be too high.</p></div>

guilty, but on animals of Angromainyu. If animals are to be killed,
we are told so expressly in the Vendidad, and this duty is often mentioned
along with the stripes (p. 209). To kill twice 90 or 200 flies or
lizards is no equivalent for murdering a man. I allow that no one
could endure blows by thousands, if they were given in earnest, yet in
running a "muck" five and six hundred very severe blows have been
endured. In my opinion the punishments of the Avesta are not intended
for legal penalties; they mark what was needed, in the opinion
of the priests, to expel the evil disposition, which could recur again
and again.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF EASTERN IRAN.</h3>


<p>Of the tribes of the Arians occupying the table-land
called by their name, those which had their habitations
on the northern slope of the Hindu Kush, in the
valleys of the Murghab and Zarefshan, outstripped the
rest in combining their forces, and uniting into a larger
community. In these regions they held advanced
posts over against the steppes and the migratory
nations of the low plains stretching before them without
limit towards the north. We had good reason to
suppose that it was the repulsion of the attacks of the
nomads from the steppes of the Oxus and Jaxartes,
which brought these tribes, whose possessions consisted
of flocks and pastures, into the habit of living in
arms, and of undertaking the protection of the country.
From their midst arose the monarchy intended to lead
and combine the defence, the formation of which we
placed about the year 1100 <small>B.C.</small>, and having its centre
at Bactria and Zariaspa. The tribes of the West, on
the other hand, for four centuries after this time lived
in isolation under their chieftains. The continuance
of the struggles which Bactria had to undergo, even
after the formation of the monarchy, is proved, not
only by the proximity of the nomads of the steppes,
but also by the traits of warlike feeling preserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
in the Avesta; by the order of warriors which existed
beside the orders of priests and husbandmen; by the
chieftains and their citadels, which we found here in
the fourth century <small>B.C.</small>; and lastly, by the circumstance,
that the old shapes of the myth of the Arians,
the spirits of the sky which smite the demons, are
changed in the Avesta not merely into ideal patterns,
but even into ancestors of the Bactrian kings, and
connected with the genealogical tree of the nation.
Yima, Thraetaona, Manuschithra, Airyu, U&ccedil;a, and
Hu&ccedil;rava, are changed into ancestors of the kings
and the people.</p>

<p>Like the Aryas in the Panjab, the tribes of the
Airyas in Iran prayed to Mithra, to the spirits of light,
the clear air, the wind, and fire, which protected them
against the demons of the night and gloom, and
gave increase to their pastures and flocks, and recovered
the water of the sky which the demons
sought to carry away. As in India, the juice of the
Soma plant was the principal offering presented to
the gods; as Soma was not only the king of plants,
the lord of nourishment and life&mdash;so the liquor
which gave strength to the gods was here also a god,
Haoma. The belief in the opposition of the spirits of
light and the spirits of destruction, in the power of
the correct sacrifice, in the influence of the good
sayings, the sacred words, was on both sides of the
Indus, the starting-point of religious ideas, and in
Iran it became the hinge on which they turned.</p>

<p>Iran was divided into fertile land and deserts;
next to the most luxuriant growth lay wide tracts, in
which heat or cold, morass or drought, storms of sand
or of snow, made life and agriculture impossible.
These contrasts were most striking on the upper Oxus,
in Sogdiana and Margiana. Hence it came to pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
that in Bactria the ancient belief in the struggle of
the good and evil spirits made an essential advance.
The old gods and spirits, the ancient worship of fire,
were not indeed overthrown by the doctrine of Zarathrustra;
on the contrary, the struggle between the
good and evil powers was spread over the whole of
nature, and the means of repelling the evil ones were
increased. The good and evil spirits were respectively
ranged under chiefs, on the counter-operation of whom
and their spirit-armies rests the life of nature; and
on this life depends the life of man. Henceforth
man must not merely keep the evil ones from himself,
he must take part in the struggle of the good against
the evil powers, increase so far as he can the good
creation which now belongs to Auramazda and has
proceeded from him; and thus restrict the sphere in
which the evil spirit exercises his power. After death
he will receive the reward of his conflict; and if in
and through this struggle he has been made a participator
in the nature of the pure and bright deities, he
will continue to live in their heaven of light.</p>

<p>This development of the old Arian views and
reform of the religion received the impulse which
eventually called it into life at the time when Vista&ccedil;pa
was king of Bactria. It must have taken place about
the year 1000 <small>B.C.</small>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> about the time when the
Brahmans on the Ganges came to reform their ancient
faith, and exalted Brahman above Indra and the
ancient deities. From the idea of this new god, in
which the power of the Holy and the world-soul were
equal factors, the Brahmans arrived at a sharp distinction
between spirit and matter. Their ethics, beginning
with the rejection of nature, could not but
require the annihilation of the body as their final
goal, and this led to the vain pursuit of impossibilities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
to the ascetic suicide of body and soul. The doctrine
of Zarathrustra does not recognise the contradiction
of spirit and matter. The good God has not created
the world in order to entangle men in evil and
wickedness, but in order to give to it and to mankind
life and increase. It is only one side of nature, not
the whole of it, and that side harmful to men, which
has proceeded from evil, and this evil does not come
from the good, but from the wicked spirit. Evil is
here limited to gloom, desolation, drought and death.
As it is this part, and this only in nature, which has
to be removed, man is not called upon to lay aside his
whole nature, but on the contrary to rejoice in the
beneficial side of it. This he must tend and strengthen
in himself, while he keeps the harmful side at a distance,
struggles against and annihilates it so far as
possible both in himself and all around him. He
must strengthen the light side of his soul against the
dark, and make it the master of the dark; he must
banish from his soul lying and deceit, idleness and
filthiness; purity of soul consists in truthfulness.
Thus must a man watch and work with the good
gods and under their eyes. It is not contemplation,
meditation, or asceticism, as in the doctrine of the
Brahmans; it is practical activity and inward effort
that the teaching of Zarathrustra requires from men;
the object it placed before men was not self-annihilation,
but the purification of soul and body, and true
assertion of self. If a man kept his body and soul
pure; if he was truthful in word and work, and increased
the good creation in meadow, field, and forest;
if he slew the animals of the evil spirits, then all
would be well with him; he would have abundance
of cattle and descendants, long life in this world, and
eternal life in the heaven of the spirits of light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>This reform had been accomplished in its fundamental
principles in Bactria, and Auramazda had been
elevated above Mithra as the creator of heaven, of
the gods, and the earth, when about the middle of the
ninth century <small>B.C.</small> the armies of Shalmanesar II. of
Asshur invaded the East of Iran. About this time,
or soon after, the order of Athravas was formed. It
rose, on the one hand, out of the ancient families of the
fire-priests, who understood the custom of sacrifice,
and had preserved the efficacious prayers to Mithra,
Verethraghna, Haoma, and Tistrya, to Ardvi&ccedil;ura and
Drva&ccedil;pa down to the period of the reform, so far as
they came over to the new doctrine; and on the other
hand, out of the race of Zarathrustra, and the families
of the zealous adherents of the new doctrine, who
devoted themselves to the service of religion. This
order of priests, which handed down in its families
the sayings of Zarathrustra and those of old days, the
ancient invocations as well as those of the new teaching,
took precedence of the families of the nobles,
warriors, and husbandmen, though they were not
separated from them by any rights of connubium or
other privileges. From the whole tendency of the
reform there could not be any thought of acquiring
such a position as that which the Brahmans&mdash;the first
created of Brahman&mdash;attained among the orders of
India. When the army of Tiglath-Pilesar II. entered
Arachosia about the middle of the eighth century <small>B.C.</small>
the new doctrine had already advanced to the West.
It was represented among the Medes by eminent
teachers. In this region, at the time when the Medes
were under the supremacy of Assyria, a priestly order
grew up out of the old families of the priests or
Magians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the powerful, and adherents of the new
doctrine; the families of this order abandoned their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
tribal connection among the Medes, and thus formed
an hereditary caste, which preserved the name already
in use in the West for the priests, and became so
numerous that it could be ranked as a tribe among
the other tribes of the Medes. The formation of this
order was already complete when, after the middle of
the seventh century <small>B.C.</small>, the Medes rebelled against
the kings of Asshur.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Athravas of the East were busily
occupied in developing and fixing the contents and
meaning of the new idea of God, and of the ethics
resulting from it. They ranged the old gods under
the new doctrine, and determined their relation to the
new supreme deity; they peopled heaven with shapes
corresponding to the reformed teaching, and brought
mythology into harmony with it; from the commands
of purity they developed in the spirit of the reformed
religion the rules of purification and the
removal of impurities as required in every occurrence
of life. Thus, beside the old invocations of the
gods, arose theories of a speculative cast which sought
to regard the gods as ethical forces, and prayers of a
formal character; from the dialectic of the priestly
schools was developed a very complicated system of
purity of life, of rubrics for expiation and purification,
in which formalism and casuistry were not
wanting. Enquiries arose how law and justice should
be shaped so as to conform to the rules of religion;
while, on the other hand, the old sacrificial songs were
collected, the liturgy was fixed, as well as the order
of the festivals and sacrifices for the new moon and
full moon, and the course of the year; the prescriptions
of medicine were written down, and those cycles
formed which comprised the battle between Auramazda
and Angromainyu down to the last and eternal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
victory of light and life. After various attempts at
compilation, the priests of the East finally succeeded in
uniting the sum of these labours into one great whole,
which was the canon of the sacred scriptures. We
may assume that the labours of the priesthood of Bactria,
which came to an end with this result, may have
occupied the same space of time as the growth and
writing down of the Brahmanas on the Ganges. There
are good reasons for supposing that the canon was
finally established about the year 600 <small>B.C.</small>, and therefore,
on the calculation given, the labours of the priests
upon it must have commenced about the year 800 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>Like the kindred tribes in India, the Arians in
Iran were not destitute of imagination and a tendency
to abstraction. But from the first these qualities
were restrained within narrower limits owing
to the nature of the land,&mdash;while the scenery and
phenomena of the Ganges tended to develop them,&mdash;and
the teaching of Zarathrustra provided a counterpoise
in the practical requirements which it set up.
Labour took the place of idle dreaming, conflict and
energetic activity the place of asceticism, and the
imagination received impulses to simple and great
conceptions. The ethics of this religion guaranteed
the conditions of a healthy human existence; man's
effort was essentially directed to this present world,
and the duties imposed upon him were such as he could
fulfil. Thus they led to results different from the introspection,
quietism, and asceticism of the Indians,
and the relapse into sensuality which was the inseparable
concomitant of the latter. The doctrine of
Zarathrustra contributed essentially to educate the
tribes which followed it in truthfulness and manliness,
and to qualify them for energy and action.
In their sensible, intelligent view of the world,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
in putting theory below practice, and aiming at an
active life, the Iranians are as far before the Indians
as the Romans are before the Greeks.</p>

<p>If Eastern Iran, in the first instance, discharged a
religious mission, the duty of politics was undertaken
by the West. The empire of the Medes and of the
Persians rose and fell, but the religion of Auramazda
survived the fall of the Ach&aelig;menids. It rose to renewed
life with the empire of the Arsacids and Sassanids.
The national reaction against the dominion of
the Seleucids began with the Parthians; the empire
of the Sassanids, which subsequently took the place of
that of the Arsacids, was supported in the first place
by the tribes of the Persians, and was connected with
the remembrance of the Ach&aelig;menids. Yet from the
first the Sassanids were prepared to deal equal measure
to the East and West of Iran; in opposition to any
attempt at religious innovation they held firmly to
the tradition of the East. When after a rule of more
than four centuries the Sassanids succumbed to the
invasion of the Arabs, Yezdegerd III. attempted to
maintain himself in Merv, as Darius III. had attempted
to maintain himself in Bactria. The attempt failed.
Iran succumbed to Islam. Yet it was the East from
which, not quite two centuries after the fall of the
Sassanids, a reaction commenced against the Arabs,
and this gradually increased till it rescued the nationality
and the language of Iran. It was the viceroys
in the districts of the East who rebelled against the
Chalifate, and they found support in the population of
their provinces. A process similar to that which had
previously broken down the dominion of the Seleucids
over Iran shattered the empire of the Abbasids. The
impulse to this movement rose in Taberistan, where
the Taherids appeared, as independent princes soon after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the death of Harun-al-Rashid; some decads later the
Soffarids rebelled in Sejestan, and towards the end of
the ninth century the power of the Samanids sprang
up in Sogdiana, Balkh, and Merv, and founded seats
in Samarcand and Bokhara. Not long after the Ziads
obtained an independent position in Dilem and Jorjan
(the ancient Hyrcania). Towards the end of the tenth
century the Ghasnavids, who had hitherto been the
servants and captains of the Samanids, threw off
their allegiance; and united under their dominion all
the lands which had been subject to the Soffarids,
the Samanids, and Ziads. Soon after the year 1000
<small>B.C.</small> they ruled from their abode in Ghasna over
Cabul, Balkh, Merv, and Chovaresm to the north, and
over Sejestan and Afghanistan to the south, and to
the west over the lands of Elburz, while their armies
crossed the Indus to the east, and advanced beyond
the Panjab to the valley of the Ganges. The ancient
religion of Iran was not wholly lost even in the time
of Harun-al-Rashid; Magians were tolerated at the
court of the Chalifs for the sake of their skill in
medicine. The Barmecides, who came from Balkh,
displayed, even under the Chalifate, a partiality for
the legends and the religion of Iran. The Samanids
boasted to be sprung from the Sassanids, the Ziads
were reproached with being idolaters in heart and
Moslem in tongue. They called themselves once more
by the names celebrated in the legends of Eastern
Iran: Minocher after Manuschithra, Kai Kobad after
Kava Kavata, Kai Kaus after Kava U&ccedil;a, Isfendyar
after &Ccedil;pentodata; and in the list of the Ghasnavids,
the Afghan princes in India, we meet at a later time
with the name of Kava Hu&ccedil;rava (Chosru).</p>

<p>The regeneration of Old Iran, in opposition to
the Arabs, found its firmest stronghold in Ghasna.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
The deeds of the Ach&aelig;menids were completely forgotten
in the East which had no part in them; but
the legends of Yima, Thraetaona, Kava Hu&ccedil;rava, and
Kava Vista&ccedil;pa, had lived on under the dominion of
the Ach&aelig;menids, the Seleucids, the Greek princes of
Balkh and Cabul, and under the Arsacids. Then
came the revival of the Avesta under Shapur II.
about the middle of the fourth century <small>A.D.</small> (p. 61).
The first Chosru (531-578 <small>A.D.</small>) caused the legends
and traditions of the nation and the priests to be
collected and copied; a comprehensive exposition of
the whole was made under the last Yezdegerd. Thus
as early as the last days of the Sassanids the tradition
of Iran was collected and fixed, and this, transcribed
in Pehlevi, outlived the fall of the kingdom, and descended
as a legacy of ancient glory to the Soffarids,
Samanids, and Ghasnavids.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> On the basis of this
"book of kings," which he possessed in an Arabic
translation, Firdusi of Tus on the Tejend, a city of
which at the present day some scanty ruins remain
not far from Meshhed, undertook to restore to life the
remembrance of the past of Eastern Iran and the
fame of her ancient heroes in a great Epic poem. He
gathered together the entire existing tradition, and
under the dominion of Islam cast a new glory on
the ancient belief in Auramazda, who was now known
as Yazdan. This poem, the book of kings (Shahnameh)
exhibits at the same time the New Persian language
in its pure form, developed out of the Eastern dialects,
and not yet contaminated with Aram&aelig;an and Arabic
elements.</p>

<p>The first king in Firdusi is Gayumart. He assembles
men and animals, and teaches the first to hide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
their nakedness with the skins of leopards. His son
Siyamek is torn in pieces by a demon. We are acquainted
with the primeval man Gayo maretan; whom
the priests placed at the beginning of things (p. 183).
Then king Hoshang taught men to harness the bull,
to tame the horse, to forge iron, to till the field, and
introduced the worship of fire. After Hoshang king
Tahmurath reigned, who overcame the Divs (Daevas),
and compelled them to teach him the art of writing.
He taught his people the art of weaving, and rode
round the world on Angromainyu (now Ahriman) till
the latter threw him off on Elburz, and so killed him.
In the Avesta Haoshyangha sacrifices in order to obtain
power over the evil spirits, and Takhmo urupa also
sacrifices in order to curb Angromainyu for the space
of thirty years (p. 183). After Tahmurath, Jemshid
(Yima) is king. He teaches the art of forging weapons
and weaving precious stuffs, divides men into priests,
warriors, husbandmen, and artisans; discovers the
art of healing, and compels the demons to build
houses, and erect for him a splendid palace and a
gorgeous throne adorned with gold and precious
stones. Three hundred years passed away while he
was king, in which the Divs were bound, and death
could not approach mankind. Then Jemshid boasted
that he had saved the world by his remedies from
sickness and death, and demanded divine honours.
This sin alienated from him the princes of his kingdom.
Jemshid was compelled to fly before Zohak,
the king of Babylon. Zohak pursued him. In the
remote East, on the sea of China, Jemshid was overtaken
and slain.</p>

<p>The old Arian legend of the happy age of Yima
shows itself even yet through Firdusi's version. Death
could not approach men under his dominion; there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
was no sickness, and therefore Jemshid is said to have
discovered the art of healing. The Avesta had already
found a motive for the fall of Yima in the fact that
he had refused to announce the law, and at length
had begun to love lies (p. 41). The Zohak of Firdusi
is no other than the ancient cloud dragon, Azhi
dahaka, which attempts to carry away the waters of
the sky, and swallows up men and horses. He is
now a foreign, hostile, bloodthirsty king, who puts an
end to the blessings of Yima's reign in order to bring
the reverse of blessing upon Iran. Azhi dahaka had
three heads and three throats; Zohak has two serpents
growing from his shoulders, to which by degrees
thousands fall as sacrifices, for they are fed with the
brains of men, and for this purpose two youths are
slaughtered every day. That Zohak is called king of
Babylon is due to a reminiscence of the fact that the
Assyrians ruled over Western Iran, and the Seleucids
and Chalifs over the whole country. Zohak persecutes
severely the descendants of Jemshid. Abtin, the
last of these, finally falls into his power; he causes
him to be slain for his serpents; but Abtin's wife
carries off his young son Feridun in safety to Elburz.
When the latter is sixteen years of age his mother
discloses to him the fate of his father; the discontented
gather round him, and the angel Serosh
teaches him how to overcome the magician Zohak.
In the citadel at Babylon Feridun strikes Zohak to
the ground with a blow of the club which Kave, the
smith, has forged for him. But Serosh bids him
not to kill Zohak, who is now chained in a deep
cave in Elburz, under Demavend, the highest summit
on the chain. Abtin, the descendant of Jemshid, is
the Athwya of the Avesta; Feridun is Thraetaona,
the son of Athwya, the slayer of Dahaka; the angel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Serosh is the well-known god &Ccedil;raosha. Feridun is
not permitted to slay Zohak, because Azhi dahaka
is also a demon.</p>

<p>Feridun has three sons&mdash;Salm (&Ccedil;airima), Tur
(Tuirya), and Yrej (Airyu); to the last, who was the
youngest, Feridun gives Iran, the best part of his
dominions, while Salm receives the West and Tur the
North. Filled with envy at the favour shown to their
youngest brother, Salm and Tur slay the pious Yrej.
Feridun is deeply moved; but he gives the daughter
whom Yrej has left in marriage to Pesheng. The
son of Pesheng is Minocher, who grows up to avenge
his grandfather's death. In order to prevent this,
Salm and Tur invade Iran. The battle continues for
three days, till Minocher has slain Tur with his own
hand. He also overtakes Salm in flight, and slays
him. Feridun can now die in peace, as he has seen
the kingdom handed over to Minocher. After the
death of the latter the kingdom descended to his son
Naudar.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Then Afrasiab of Turan, the great-grandson
of Tur, whom Minocher had slain, invaded Iran to
avenge the death of his ancestor on the descendant
of Minocher. Naudar's army was defeated; he was
taken captive with many princes of Iran, and beheaded
by the order of Afrasiab.</p>

<p>Besides the race of Abtin, Jemshid had left other
descendants. In union with the daughter of the king
of Cabul, whose kingdom extends from Bost on the
Hilmend to Ghasna (and consequently includes the
region of Sejestan, the ancient Haetumat),<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> he had
begotten Gershasp, a mighty hero who stood by the
side of Minocher in the struggle against Salm and
Tur; the sons of Gershasp are Neriman and Sam, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
his grandson is Zal. The Gershasp of Firdusi is the
Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa of the Avesta, the son of Thrita, of the race
of &Ccedil;ama (p. 35), who slays the serpent &Ccedil;ruvara and
the giant Gandarewa. The Avesta gives him the
epithet Nairimanao, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the man-hearted, heroic, and
represents him as seizing the brilliance of majesty,
when it departed for the third time from Yima (p.
36). This hint was enough to give the royal power
to Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa; his epithet and his tribal name are
personified, and become his descendants Neriman and
Sam. In accordance with their origin these princes
from Zabul are in Firdusi the most faithful adherents
of the race of Feridun, which has rewarded them with
the dominion over the South. In this way the legend
of Sejestan is woven into the closest connection with the
legend of the Avesta. The power of the descendants of
Feridun is extinguished with Naudar, from whose sons
"the splendour of the royal majesty shines no longer;"
thus does Firdusi repeat the metaphor current in the
Avesta. The princes of Zabul now take their place
as the protectors and guardians of Iran. The son of
king Sam of Zabul is Zal. After Naudar's melancholy
fall he makes peace between Iran and Turan; the
Oxus is fixed as the boundary, Afrasiab returns to his
own country, and in the place of the sons of Naudar
Zal allows Zav to be chosen king of Iran. Zav is
already aged and soon dies; Afrasiab invades Iran
again. Then Zal deliberates with the Mobedhs (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
with the chiefs of the Magians, p. 60), who is to be
king of Iran. It is resolved to raise Kai Kobad to the
throne, who like Feridun before him dwells on Elburz.
Zal sends his son Rustem (Moses of Khorene is the
first who mentions the Persian legend of Rustem), a
youth of great strength, who as a boy had slain an
infuriated elephant, to fetch Kai Kobad from Elburz.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Rustem finds him prepared, for he has seen in a dream
two white falcons who place a golden crown upon
his head. Afrasiab's army, which opposes him, is
defeated; Kai Kobad ascends the throne of Iran,
the Turanians are defeated in a great battle, Rustem
seizes Afrasiab by his girdle and drags him from his
horse; but the girdle breaks, Afrasiab falls to the
ground, and is saved by his own people. In the peace
the Oxus is once more fixed as the boundary between
Iran and Turan. Kai Kobad is followed by his son
Kai Kaus. Against the advice of his vassals and of
Zal he leads his army against Mazanderan, a land
inhabited by demons, which take the king captive
with his whole army. A single warrior escapes to bring
the terrible news to Zal. As Zal is now 200 years old,
Rustem undertakes to liberate the king. He has to
overcome seven terrible monsters before he can arrive
at the demons. At last he makes his way to them,
and on his horse Reksh, he destroys the army of the
demons. Then he slays their chief, the white demon,
in the dark cave, and liberates Kai Kaus and the army
of Iran. Kai Kaus now causes the conquered demons
to build him splendid palaces on Elburz, and resolves
to fly up to heaven, in order to see the course of the
sun. Four eagles bound to his throne carry him
upwards, but then allow him to fall to earth. Ashamed
at his pride he humbles himself, and his penance
appeases the wrath of heaven. When Afrasiab breaks
the peace and again invades Iran, Kai Kaus sends his
son Siavaksh, under the guidance of Rustem, against
the Turanians. For three days the battle rages at the
gates of Balkh, and at length Siavaksh is victorious.
Afrasiab sues for peace, Siavaksh concludes a treaty;
but Kai Kaus will not confirm it. That he may not
break his word, Siavaksh gives himself up to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Turanians. Afrasiab receives him with honour, and
gives him his daughter Feringis to wife. Subsequently
he harbours suspicion against him, causes him to be
executed, and the son, whom Feringis bears after the
execution of her husband, to be brought up among
the shepherds without any knowledge of his birth.
To this son an abode is then allotted in a remote
region of Turan.</p>

<p>To avenge the execution of Siavaksh Rustem invades
Turan. Victorious in the battle he causes
Surkha, the son of Afrasiab, whom he captures in the
battle, to be put to death in the same way as Siavaksh,
pursues Afrasiab to the extreme border of his kingdom,
and does not return till the whole of Turan has been
laid waste: the booty is immense. Many years afterwards
it was revealed in a dream to Guderz (Gotarzes),
a descendant of that Kave, who had once forged for
Feridun the club used against Zohak, that a son of
Siavaksh survived. Gev, the son of Guderz, arose to
seek in Turan the right heir to the throne of Iran.
For seven years he seeks in vain. At length he
discovers Kai Chosru, to whom his mother Feringis has
already revealed the secret of his birth. In spite of
the most severe persecution on the part of Afrasiab,
Gev succeeds in carrying away mother and son to
Iran; they swim through the swollen Oxus on horseback.
But when Kai Kaus wishes to make the grandson
so happily discovered his successor, Tur, the son of
king Naudar, opposes the elevation of a king who has
Turanian blood in his veins. Kai Chosru proves his
higher claim by capturing a citadel of the demons,
and erecting a fire-altar in its place. Then he sets
himself to avenge the death of his father on Afrasiab.
But the first army of the Iranians under Tur is
defeated; and when Feriborz receives the command<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the warriors of Iran are again severely beaten in the
valley of Peshen; a third army is shut up on Mount
Hamaven. To liberate this Rustem sets forth, and
conquers in the most terrible battle which he has ever
fought. At length Afrasiab and Kai Chosru take the
lead of their armies. After a bloody struggle the
Turanians are compelled to retire, first beyond the
Oxus, and then beyond the Jaxartes. Afrasiab flies
for refuge to his fortified city Kang Bihist; the city
is taken, but he escapes into a cave. Kai Kaus and
Kai Chosru entreat the fire Adar gu&ccedil;asp, that Afrasiab
may not escape them. A pious penitent, Hom, who
hears the lament of Afrasiab in his cave, recognises
him, overpowers and binds him, and leads him forth.
Afrasiab entreats the penitent to loose his bonds, and
then escapes once more, into a lake. The pious Hom
obtains possession of him again, and hands him over
to Kai Chosru, who has his head cut off in revenge for
his father Siavaksh. Kai Kaus has now seen the
fulfilment of vengeance on Afrasiab for the death of
Siavaksh; his days draw to a close. For sixty years
after him, Kai Chosru rules over Iran in peace, and
then resolves to enter on a pilgrimage to heaven.
When the angel Serosh has bidden him nominate
Lohrasp as his successor, he fulfils this injunction,
establishes Rustem as general-in-chief of the kingdom
and successor of his father Zal in the kingdom of the
South, and after long meditation, accompanied by the
sons of Naudar, Tus and Gustehem, and the heroes
Gev and Feriborz, he begins the pilgrimage to the
East. When high up in the mountains he advises
his companions to return; soon they will see him no
more. He disappears after bathing in a spring; his
heroes, in spite of the command to return, seek for
him, and are buried in a storm of snow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>We saw above that in the Avesta, Manuschithra
and Airyu are connected with Thraetaona, and that
the group of the Paradhatas comes to an end with
these names. Hence Firdusi also represents the crown
as being brought to the first ruler of the new group,
Kai Kobad, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Kava Kavata of the Avesta, from
the sky by two falcons; he also represents him as
being fetched from Elburz, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> from the holy mountain
of the old legend, in order to overcome Zohak,
just as Thraetaona descended from the same mountain.
Kai Kaus, the Kava U&ccedil;a of the Avesta, who succeeded
Kai Kobad, betrays his divine nature in Firdusi by his
march against the demons, by the castles which these
demons build for him on Elburz, and by his attempt
to fly into heaven. In the Avesta Kava U&ccedil;a offers
sacrifice, in order to obtain the dominion over men
and Daevas, and this favour is granted to him. That
the march against the demons is made in the direction
of Mazanderan is due no doubt to the frequent mention
of the Mazanian Devs in the Avesta. Siavaksh, the
son of Kai Kaus, who honourably gives himself up to
the Turanians, is the &Ccedil;yavarshana of the Avesta&mdash;from
which we merely learn that he was spotless, and
that after Kava U&ccedil;a the royal majesty united with
the beautiful body of &Ccedil;yavarshana, and that he died
by a violent death (p. 37). The destructive Turanian
Franghra&ccedil;yana, who is now called Afrasiab, is known
to the Avesta. "Thrice," we are told, "he sought
after the royal majesty which belongs to the Arian
lands, but he found it not."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Kai Chosru, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> Kava
Hu&ccedil;rava, is in the Avesta also the son of &Ccedil;yavarshana;
he offers sacrifice, in order that it may be granted
to him "to put an end to the long period of dimness,"
"to bind the Franghra&ccedil;yana filled with abundance;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
he is said to be "without sickness and death." Firdusi's
poem neglects none of these traits. After the
triple war which, kindled by Afrasiab, has lasted for a
long time, Firdusi represents Chosru as invoking the
fire Gu&ccedil;asp, that Afrasiab may not escape him. In
the Avesta the god Haoma is said himself to bind
Franghra&ccedil;yana, and to carry him away as a captive of
king Hu&ccedil;rava, in order that the latter may slay him
beyond the lake Chaecha&ccedil;ta (p. 37). In Firdusi the
pious Hom discovers the hiding-place of Afrasiab; he
binds him and carries him away a prisoner. Afrasiab
escapes; but Hom captures him once more in lake
Kanyesht. As Hu&ccedil;rava is "without sickness and
death," Firdusi represents him as vanishing on a
pilgrimage to heaven.</p>

<p>In Firdusi, Lohrasp, whom Chosru has made his
successor, erects a fire-temple at Balkh, his royal
abode, and after reigning 120 years, abdicates in
favour of Gushtasp, his elder son, in order to devote
his life to pious exercises at his temple. When Zartusht
proclaims the Avesta, Gushtasp and his wife
receive the new doctrine. But Arjasp, the king of
Turan, sent Gushtasp a command not to listen to the
words of Zartusht. To this request Gushtasp did not
accede; a battle took place on the banks of the Oxus,
which turned in favour of Iran, owing to the bravery
of Zarir, the brother of Gushtasp. An arrow from an
ambush lays the hero low at the moment of victory.
His death terrifies the Iranians; not one of them
ventures to avenge it till Gushtasp promises Isfendyar,
the strongest and bravest of his sons, that he will
give him the crown if he succeeds in avenging the
death of Zarir. Isfendyar overthrows the warriors
of Iran, brings the arms and horse of Zarir into the
camp of Iran, and Arjasp retires into his land. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the place of the promised crown, Isfendyar receives
from his father the high mission of spreading abroad
the new faith. By means of a chain which he places
on his neck, Zartusht makes Isfendyar invulnerable,
and surrounds him with a charm so that anyone who
slays him will himself quickly die. When Isfendyar
returns home after a long time, his mission fully accomplished,
as all have received the law of Zartusht,
accusations are made against him that he is collecting
an army to dethrone his father. On this unfounded
charge Gushtasp causes Isfendyar to be cast into
prison. But while he remains in Zabul, the Turanians
attack Balkh. The aged Lohrasp takes up arms; he
cannot check the Turanians; he falls; the city is
taken: Zartusht with the fire-priests is slain in the
fire-temple, the sacred fire is quenched in their blood,
and two daughters of Gushtasp are carried away to
Turan. In vain does Gushtasp hasten up, when he
has collected his army; thirty-eight of his sons are
slain in the battle against the Turanians. Gushtasp
takes to flight, and with his warriors finds refuge in a
mountain which is quickly invested by Arjasp. Then
Jamasp, the faithful adviser of Gushtasp, passes in
disguise through the camp of the Turanians, to fetch
Isfendyar out of prison, and urge him to save his
father and Iran. Forgetting his deep injury and wrong,
Isfendyar forces a way through the camp of Arjasp,
and in the subsequent battle slaughters so many of the
enemy's men that he takes to flight. But the task is
not yet accomplished; it still remains to set at liberty
the two sisters whom the Turanians had carried away
from Balkh, and whom Arjasp keeps imprisoned in
"the brazen fortress." After seven conflicts, corresponding
to those which Rustem had to undergo, when
he liberated Kai Kaus from the power of the demons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Isfendyar reaches the fortress. He sends his army
back, and in the guise of a merchant obtains entrance
into the citadel. Here he asks Arjasp, to whom he is
unknown, for permission to give a feast to the principal
men on the turrets of the citadel. When the
wine has done its work, Isfendyar gives the signal of
fire already agreed upon to his followers; the garrison
is overpowered; Arjasp is slain by Isfendyar in single
combat, and Isfendyar returns victorious with his
sisters to Balkh.</p>

<p>Here a new and yet more dangerous task awaits
him. Rustem, who made Kai Kobad ruler of Iran,
and has since done such good service, and achieved
such noble acts for Kai Kaus and Kai Chosru, remains
at a distance from the court and army of king
Gushtasp. He despises the doctrine of Zartusht.
At Gushtasp's bidding Isfendyar must break down
this opposition, and bring him to the king. Isfendyar
marches out and commands Rustem to follow
him in chains to the court. With a heavy heart
Rustem seeks to withdraw from the contest; he treats
with Isfendyar; but the latter obstinately insists on
his terms. Nothing remains for the aged hero but to
give battle against his will. Isfendyar's invulnerable
body resists his blows, and Reksh, the horse of Rustem,
is wounded; Rustem is himself wounded and compelled
to retire. He has no hope of conquering in
the battle which is to begin again on the next day.
In his deep distress he calls to the bird Simurgh, who
comes, sucks the blood from his wound, and heals the
horse. Simurgh is acquainted with the future, and
advises a compromise: there is indeed a way of
overcoming Isfendyar, but anyone who takes his life
"must not expect salvation in this world or the next."
Rustem cannot bring himself to suffer defeat in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
battle, and therefore in the night Simurgh carries him
away to the tree of life, on the sea of China, and bids
him break off the branch to which Isfendyar's life is
bound. Out of this branch is cut the death-arrow for
the conflict of the morrow. With it Rustem hits
the place in the eye in which alone Isfendyar is
vulnerable. But for Rustem also the lot of death is
cast. He is invited by the king of Cabul, a tributary
prince, to hunt; and the king's son-in-law, Sheghad,
prepares a pit filled with swords and lances, for the
destruction of the aged hero. Into this Rustem falls
with his horse, but even in the moment of death his
arrow hits Sheghad, who had concealed himself in a
hollow tree, in order to watch the success of his
scheme. Rustem's son Feramorz avenges the murder
of his father on the king of Cabul; but Gushtasp
renounces the world, and transfers the government
to his grandson Bahman, the son of Isfendyar.</p>

<p>Here also we find traces of the Avesta underlying
the poem. In the Avesta Aurvata&ccedil;pa, now Lohrasp,
and Vista&ccedil;pa, now Gushtasp, form a group distinct
from the most ancient princes. Firdusi represents
Kai Chosru as making Lohrasp his successor in spite
of the murmurs of the nobles. Arejata&ccedil;pa, now Arjasp,
the Turanian, sacrifices in the Avesta in order to
obtain victory over Vista&ccedil;pa, and the great equestrian,
Zairivairi, the brother of Vista&ccedil;pa. In Firdusi this
brother, the bravest warrior of Iran against Turan, is
Zarir. In the Avesta Vista&ccedil;pa conquers Arejata&ccedil;pa; in
Firdusi Arjasp finally succumbs in the conflict. In the
Avesta Jama&ccedil;pa is a prince of great influence with Vista&ccedil;pa;
in Firdusi he is his faithful counsellor. In the
Avesta Zarathrustra offers sacrifice that he may unite
with the warlike Vista&ccedil;pa, and that the king's consort
Hutao&ccedil;a may impress the law on her memory (p. 37);<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
in Firdusi Gushtasp and his wife receive the new law.
According to the Avesta Vista&ccedil;pa has given his support
and protection to the law, has set up the law in
the world, and given it a high position, and made the
path broad for purity. In Firdusi Isfendyar is sent
to spread abroad the new law over the earth. The
Avesta mentions twenty-nine sons of Vista&ccedil;pa, Firdusi
even more; in both &Ccedil;pentodata (Isfendyar) has the
first place. In the Avesta Zarathrustra pronounces a
blessing on Vista&ccedil;pa, in Firdusi he pronounces it on
Isfendyar. That the latter was extolled, even in the
Avesta, as supporting the faith and spreading it abroad&mdash;though
our fragments do not allow us to draw any
further conclusions&mdash;is nevertheless clear from the
creed of the Parsees: "I abide in the law which the
lord Ormuzd taught to Zartusht, and Zartusht to
king Gushtasp, and Gushtasp to Frashaostra (p. 62),
Jamasp, and Isfendyar, and these to all the faithful
in the world." Firdusi has made use of the spread of
the new law by Isfendyar, in order to bring to a conclusion
the legend of Sejestan which he connects with
the tradition of the Avesta, and to provide an adequate
motive for the fall of the mighty Rustem of Ghasna,
the descendant of the mighty Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa. In his zeal
for the faith, Isfendyar demands more than Rustem
can grant; the champion of the faith is stronger in
the conflict than Rustem; and the latter, in order
to keep his honour, avails himself of wicked magical
arts. We have seen what was the occupation of the
two eagles of the sky, Amru and Chamru, at the tree
in Lake Vourukasha, which bears the seeds of all life
(p. 172). To these arts the champion of the faith
succumbs, but by his success the victor has pronounced
judgment on himself.</p>

<p>In the form which Firdusi has given them, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
legends of Ancient Iran have to some extent continued
to live among the people, and to some extent
they have failed. The Shahnameh celebrates Jemshid's
(Yima's) glittering palace and splendid throne; hence
the ruins of the great palace of the Ach&aelig;menids at
Persepolis have gained the name of the throne of
Jemshid; ruins near Bamiyan in the Hindu-Kush, on
the road from Balkh to Cabul, are still called Zohak's
castle. The smoke rising out of the crater of Demavend
is the breath of Zohak chained in the depths of
the mountain. Each year, on the last day of August,
the inhabitants of Elburz celebrate the festival of the
overthrow of Zohak with bonfires on every height,
and demonstrations of joy. The ruins of Takt-i-Bostan
are called the garden of Kai Chosru, and in Iran
Balkh is still the mother of cities.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> A lofty and steep
rock in Lake Zirreh in Sejestan is said to have been
crowned with the castle of Rustem, and the site of a
second castle is pointed out at Aivan. Aqueducts
and dams pass for works of Rustem. In the desert
of Beluchistan, the ancient Gedrosia, the tracks of the
camels of Rustem are still shown by large stones in
the sand. In Mazanderan is the battle-field where
Rustem defeated the Divs in order to liberate Kai
Kaus (p. 253). The sculptures of the Ach&aelig;menids on
the tombs at Persepolis are called pictures of Rustem
(Naksh-i-Rustem), and in the bed of the Hilmend his
grave is shown. When Timour's Mongols devastated
Sejestan in the fourteenth century, the people called
on Rustem to raise his head from the grave, and
behold Iran in the hand of his enemy, the warrior of
Turan. By a strange misconception the nobles in
Mazanderan assume the name Div as a title of honour.
A large family of nobles in Sejestan call themselves
Ka&iuml;anids, and boast of their descent from Jemshid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
and the ancient kings, and to this family, down to
the most recent times, the viceroyalty of Sejestan
belonged as an hereditary office. When the holder
of it died, the eldest of the family went to court
in order to apply for the office, and was duly installed
by investment with the robe of honour and armour.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>While the ancient legends have lived on in Iran,
the religion of Zoroaster has passed beyond Iran, and
survives on the Malabar coast. Every day the Parsees
utter their invocations before the sacred fire, and
present bowls filled with the juice of the Haoma.
Each month, as we have seen, belongs to one of the
heavenly deities, who is then specially invoked; each
of the thirty days of the month has its own protecting
spirit, who is especially honoured on his own day.
Six yearly festivals, each of five days, celebrate the
creation of the heaven, water, the earth, the trees,
animals, and men (p. 182); on each of which special
prayers are said. At the close of the year the
Parsees purify and adorn their houses, in order to
receive worthily the souls of their ancestors: sacrificial
bread, fruits, milk, wine, and meat are put ready for
them. The Fravashis, now called Farvars, are invoked
"to receive the sacrifice, to lift up their hands
to it, and depart in peace from the dwelling."<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> On
these days the priests read the liturgies appointed as
prayers for the souls of the damned, and for ten days
the laity have to repeat many thousands of times the
prayers "Ahuna-vairya" and "Ashem Vohu." Each
morning, on waking, the Parsee prays: "The best
purity is to the just, who is pure. He is pure who
does pure works. I pray with purity of thought, of
word, and act." When removing, and again when
putting on, his girdle (p. 217), he says, with face
turned to the East: "May Ormuzd be king; may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Ahriman be defeated and destroyed; may the enemies
be confounded, and remain far off; of all my sins I
repent." Then he takes gomez for ablutions, washes
his face and hands with it, rubs himself with earth,
and with gomez in his hand says: "May Ahriman be
destroyed; may the thirty-three Amshaspands and
Ormuzd be victorious and pure." After a prayer to
&Ccedil;rosh (&Ccedil;raosha)&mdash;"the pure and strong, may he increase
to greater majesty, whose body is the word, and
whose club is victorious"&mdash;follows ablution with water,
dressing of the fire with wood and perfumes, and the
proper morning prayer to Ushahin, the spirit of the
morning: "Praise to thee, high Dawn." When it is
light, a prayer is offered to Mithra, and two others
at midday and sunset. In the morning a prayer to
Ormuzd is recited, in which all his names and qualities
are enumerated. Before eating, the Parsee must wash
himself and pronounce the prayer "Ahuna-vairya,"
and after eating, the prayer "King Ormuzd." When
the Parsee goes to rest he must arrange his bed in
such a way that he lies towards the fire, or the moon,
or the East. Before sleeping, a prayer is offered to
Ormuzd. On turning over in bed, sneezing, the
discharge of natural or sexual functions, kindling a
light, approaching water or fire, special prayers are
uttered, and the sum of daily duties is increased on
many occasions in family life&mdash;at the time of a birth,
or death, or festivals, and when impurities have been
incurred. However external and formal these numerous
prayers and rituals may appear, the Parsee forms of
confession are nevertheless evidence of the depth of
their religious feeling, and their retention in the
family and social life proves that the ancient religion
still possesses a powerful influence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE FOUNDATION OF THE MEDIAN KINGDOM.</h3>


<p>On the northern edge of the table-land of Iran, where
the mountains descend to the Caspian Sea, we found
dwelling towards the east the Hyrcanians (<i>Vehrkana</i>
in the Avesta, <i>Varkana</i> in the inscriptions of Darius).<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
Their territory may have corresponded to the modern
district of Jorjan, which has preserved their name
(p. 9). To the west of the Hyrcanians, between
Elburz and the Caspian, lay the Tapurians, whose
name has survived in the modern Taberistan, and
further yet, on the sea-coast, and at the mouth of the
Mardus (now Safidrud), were the Mardians. Adjacent
to these, on the shores of the Caspian Sea as far as
the mouth of the Cyrus, lay the nation whom the
Greeks called Cadusians, but whose native name was
Gaels<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>&mdash;a name still preserved in the name of the
district of Ghilan.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> To the south of these tribes&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
Tapurians, Mardians, and Cadusians&mdash;the north-west
of the table-land was entirely occupied by the Medes.</p>

<p>The country of the Medes, Herodotus tells us, is
very high and mountainous in the north towards the
Euxine, and covered with forests, but the remainder
of it is flat.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Polybius gives a more minute description
of the nature of Media. "It is difficult to speak
adequately of the natural strength and of the extent
of the country of the Medes. It lies in the centre of
Asia, and in the size and elevation of the land surpasses
all other parts, while the situation enables it
to govern the strongest and most populous nations.
Towards the east it is protected by the desert which
lies between Persia and Parthia, it has control of the
Caspian gates, and abuts on the mountains of the
Tapurians, which are not far distant from the Hyrcanian
Sea. Towards the north it is bounded by the
Matieni and Cadusians, on the west it extends to the
Saspeires, who dwell close to the tribes which lie on
the Euxine. Towards the south it extends to Mesopotamia
and abuts on Persia; on this side it is
protected by the range of the Zagrus, which reaches
an elevation of one hundred stadia, and is broken into
various ranges and groups, separated by deep valleys
and open plains, in which dwell the Carchi, Cossaei,
and other warlike tribes. Media itself is traversed
by several ranges in the direction from east to west,
but between them are plains filled with cities and
villages. The Medes possess corn and cattle in
untold abundance, and in horses their country is
superior to the whole of Asia, so that it takes the first
place, not only in virtue of its extent, but also owing
to the number and excellence of the men and horses."<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
Strabo allows Media an extent of 4000 stades (500<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
miles) in length and breadth. It reached from the
Zagrus to the Caspian gates. The greater part of the
land was high and cold, but the district below the
Caspian gates on the lower ground was very fertile.
Even in the rest of the land, with the exception of
some mountain districts, there was no lack of the
means of subsistence, and everywhere on the high
ground there was excellent pasture for horses.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>The nation of the Medes belongs to the group of
the Arian tribes, which occupied the table-land of
Iran. This has been already proved by the statement
of Herodotus that in ancient time the Medians were
called Areans by all men (p. 14), by the religion of
the Medes, and by all the Median words and names
that have come down to us.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> According to Herodotus
the nation consisted of six tribes: the Arizanti, Busae,
Struchates, Budii, Paraetaceni, and Magi. Whether
certain parts of the land belonged to these tribes as
their habitation, is not clear from this statement.
The Magians we have already found to be a hereditary
order of priests (p. 191), and therefore we can hardly
assume a separate part of the country as their habitation.
The question thus becomes limited to the
remaining five tribes. The name of the Paraetaceni
occurs in the mountain district, which the later Greeks
call Paraetacene. This district separated Media from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Persia, and there is therefore nothing remarkable in
the fact that the Paraetaceni are counted among the
Persians or spoken of as an independent tribe.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> If
the Paraetaceni had a special province, we shall be all
the more justified in allotting the same to the Arizanti,
the Budii, Struchates, and Busae, as the tribe of the
Matieni, which Strabo reckons among the Medes,<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
had a special habitation and territory in the district of
Matiene, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the region which after the time of the
Seleucids was known as Atropatene; and the tribes
of the Persians, who were closely akin to the Medes,
were also settled in special regions, or marched through
them with their flocks. The name Arizanti (<i>Arizantu</i>)
might signify the noble families, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> an eminent tribe,
which tribe might nevertheless possess a separate
habitation. Among the Persians there was a privileged
tribe, to which the royal family belonged, which
ruled over all the tribes, and this tribe like the rest
had a special territory.</p>

<p>The districts of Media, as we know them from
the accounts of later writers, are beside Atropatene:
Choromithrene, Nisaea, Rhagiana, Cambadene, and
Bagistana.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> Atropatene is the elevated plain which
spreads round the lake which Ptolemy calls the
Matienian lake (now Urumiah). The inscriptions of the
kings of Asshur call the inhabitants of this land Mati
and Mala.<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Shut in by mighty summits which reach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
a height of more than 12,000 feet, naked ridges, fields
of snow, mountain pastures, green forests and meadows
here make up the wildest, but at the same time most
beautiful, Alpine landscape in the west of Iran. The
snow lies on the backs of the heights for about nine
months, but in the valleys there reigns for the most
part uninterrupted spring; in the deeper clefts the
summer is hot, and the naphtha springs must have
caused this region to appear as one highly favoured
by the gods in the eyes of such zealous worshippers
of fire as the Arians of Iran. We have already seen
(p. 74) that the name Atropatene, which in middle
Persian is Aturpatkan, and modern Persian Aderbeijan,
means "protected by fire."</p>

<p>In the ranges of the Zagrus, which, running from
the Alps of Atropatene to the south-east, separate
the table-land of Iran from the valley of the Tigris&mdash;these
summits rise above the hilly land of Assyria to
a height of 15,000 feet&mdash;we must seek the territory
which Ptolemy calls Choromithrene, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> by a name
which beyond doubt goes back to the worship of
Mithra. Further to the east, beyond the isolated
mountain-group of Elvend, on the eastern foot of the
mountains, lay the territory where Ecbatana was subsequently
built. To the south-east were the "Nis&aelig;an
plains" of Herodotus, on which, as he tells us, were
kept the most beautiful and largest horses, superior
to those of the Indians.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Polybius has already
stated, that in regard to horses Media surpassed
the rest of Asia; the mares of the Parthian kings
were kept in Media owing to the excellent pastures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
According to Strabo, there were 50,000 mares on the
"horse pastures" in the time of the Ach&aelig;menids;
these pastures any one going from Babylonia and
Persia to the Caspian gates, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> to the Sirdarra-pass
in Elburz, would cross. Diodorus places them seven
days' march to the east of Behistun, and tells us that
at one time there were 160,000 wild horses here,
though Alexander found only 60,000. Arrian puts
the previous number at 150,000, and the number
found by Alexander at 50,000, as the greater part
had been carried off by robbers.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> That Herodotus has
given the name of this region correctly is shown by
the inscriptions of Darius, which speak of a province
of Ni&ccedil;aya in Media.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> To the north-east of the region
of Ecbatana, on an elevated plateau, lay the district
of Raghiana. It takes its name from the metropolis
Ragha, a city on the southern foot of Elburz, mentioned
both in the Avesta and the inscriptions.
Under the Arsacids Ragha was the largest city of
Media. Its later name was Rai; the ruins (near the
modern Teheran) are said to cover the land for leagues.
Besides Ragha there were at one time numerous
flourishing cities in Raghiana.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Campadene,<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> the
Campada of the inscriptions of Darius, we must look
for in the south of Media, to the east of the Zagrus;
it is no doubt the district now called Chamabatan.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
According to the statement of the Greeks, the district
of Bagistana extended to a mountain which was sacred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
to Zeus. As Diodorus says, it was a region fit for
the gods, filled with fruit-trees and every other
kind that ministers to delight and enjoyment.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> The
name of the mountain consecrated to Zeus, Bagistana,
and the similar name of the district, go back to the
title under which the gods are comprised in the Avesta
and the inscriptions of Darius (Old Bactr. <i>bagha</i>,
Old Pers. <i>baga</i>, New Pers. <i>bag</i>); and if Diodorus tells
us that the region was a land fit for the gods, the
name Bagistana means the abode of the gods. The
district may have been held peculiarly sacred by the
Medes, or the name may have been intended to express
their gratitude for its fertility and beauty. We can
fix precisely the position of this district by the hill
consecrated to Zeus near the modern Behistun. It
lies south-west of Elvend, between that mountain and
the Zagrus in the valley of the Choaspes, and is the
district now known as Kirmenshah.</p>

<p>According to the statements of Berosus, the historian
of Babylon, the Medes in the most ancient
period had already reigned over Babylonia for more
than two centuries. They had suddenly collected an
army, reduced Babylonia, and there set up tyrants of
their own people. According to the succession of the
dynasties which Berosus represents as ruling over
Babylonia, the beginning of this supremacy of the
Medes fell, as has been shown (I. 241, 247), in the
year 2458 <small>B.C.</small> The first of the Medes who thus ruled
in Babylon is called Zoroaster by Syncellus, after
Polyhistor; according to this writer the seven Medes
reign till the year 2224 <small>B.C.</small> Whether Berosus
called the first Median king who reigned in Babylon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Zoroaster, or Polyhistor has ascribed that position to
him as the most famous name in Iran, or the only
name known in antiquity, must be left undecided, no
less than the actual fact of the Median supremacy.</p>

<p>The Medo-Persian epos told us that Ninus of Asshur,
after subjugating Babylonia and Armenia, attacked
the Medes. Pharnus, their king, met him with a
mighty army, but was nevertheless beaten. He was
crucified with his wife and seven children by Ninus;
one of his retinue was made viceroy of Media; and for
many years the Medes were subject to the successors
of Ninus on the throne of Assyria (II. 3 ff). Herodotus'
account is as follows: "When the Assyrians had
reigned over upper Asia for 520 years, the Medes
were the first to revolt, and as they fought bravely for
their freedom against the Assyrians, they succeeded in
escaping slavery and liberating themselves. Afterwards
the rest of the nations did what the Medes had done.
And as all the nations of the mainland lived according
to laws of their own, they again fell under a tyranny
in the following manner:&mdash;Among the Medes was a
man of ability, called Deioces, the son of Phraortes.
He desired the tyranny, and did as follows: The
Medes dwelt in villages, and Deioces, who was previously
a man of importance, set himself more and
more zealously to the task of doing justice, since
lawlessness reigned throughout the whole of Media.
When the Medes of his village discovered these qualities
in him, they chose him for their judge. And as
his heart was already set on the empire, he acted justly
and rightly, and thus got no small credit among his
fellow-citizens, so that the men from other villages,
when they found that Deioces alone judged rightly,
gladly resorted to him, since hitherto they had had to
endure unjust sentences, and at last they would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
go to any one else. As the number of the applicants
became greater, and Deioces found that everything
depended upon him, he refused to sit any longer in
court and pronounce sentence, saying, that it was of no
advantage to himself to neglect his own business and
spend the day in settling the disputes of others. Then
robbery and lawlessness became more rife than ever
in the villages, and the Medes gathered together and
consulted on the position of affairs. In my belief the
friends of Deioces were the first to speak: 'As things
are, it is impossible to live in the land; let us choose
some one to be king, and thus the land will obtain
good government. We can occupy ourselves with our
own business, and shall not be compelled to wander
from home.' With these words they persuaded the
Medes to set up a monarchy. And when they at once
began the discussion who should be king, Deioces
was highly commended and put forward by every one,
so that at last he was chosen by all to be king. Then
Deioces commanded the Medes to build him a palace
suitable for a king, and strengthen his power by a
body-guard. This they did, and built a great and
strong palace, on the place which Deioces pointed out
to them, and allowed him to choose his lance-bearers
out of all the nation. When he had obtained the
sovereign power he at once compelled the Medes to
build him a large city, in order that, being thus
occupied, they might trouble him less about other
things; and when the Medes obeyed him in this matter
also, he erected the great and strong citadel now known
as Ecbatana. The walls formed seven circles, in such
a manner that the inner was always higher by the
turrets than the next outer circle, an arrangement
assisted by the locality, for the town was situated on
a hill. In the seventh wall was the palace and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
treasure-house of Deioces. After erecting this fortification
for himself, and his palace, the king commanded
the people to settle round the citadel. When the
building was completed Deioces first made the arrangement
that no one should enter in to the king, but
every thing was done by messengers, in order that
those who had grown up with him, and were of
similar age, equal in descent and bravery, might not
envy him, and set conspiracies on foot, but that by
being invisible he might appear a different being; it
was also disgraceful to laugh or spit, or do anything of
that kind in his presence. When he had made these
arrangements, and thus strengthened his tyranny, he
adhered strictly to justice. Plaints had to be sent in to
him in writing, and he sent back the sentence. Thus
he managed this and all other matters, and if he found
that any one was guilty of insolence, and did violence
to others, he punished him according to the measure
of his offence, and his spies and emissaries were everywhere
in the land.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> In this manner Deioces united
the Medes, and governed them for 53 years. After
his death, his son Phraortes succeeded to the throne.
Not content with ruling over the Medes only, he
marched against the Persians, and first made them
subject to the Medes. When he had become master
of these two powerful nations, he subjugated all Asia,
attacking one nation after another. Finally, he marched
against the Assyrians, who had previously ruled over
all men, but, though otherwise in excellent condition,
were then abandoned by their allies, who had revolted.
In the war against these Phraortes fell, after a reign
of 22 years, and with him the greatest part of his
army."<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>The account of the history of the Medes given by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Ctesias is wholly different. As their subjugation to
Assyria is coeval with the founding of that kingdom,
so is their liberation coeval with the fall of it. When
the Medes, after their conquest by Ninus, had been
subject to the rulers of Asshur, down to his thirty-sixth
successor, Arbaces, the viceroy of Media, with
Belesys, the viceroy of Babylonia, revolted from the
Assyrian king. The kingdom of Assyria still remains
unbroken; it is only after severe struggles, and in
consequence of the desertion of the Bactrians and
other nations during the conflict, that it is overthrown.
After the capture of Nineveh, Arbaces, as supreme
lord, takes the place of the king of Asshur.</p>

<p>According to the dates of Herodotus Deioces ascended
the throne of Media in the year 714 or 708 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
The time which elapsed between the liberation of the
Medes and Deioces' elevation is not given by him.
According to Ctesias Arbaces established the dominion
of the Medes at least 170 years before the date given
by Herodotus for Deioces. In Herodotus Phraortes,
Cyaxares, and Astyages follow Deioces in the dominion
over the Medes, with a total of 97 years. In Ctesias
the successors of Arbaces, who reigns 28 years, are
Mandaces with a reign of 50 years, Sosarmus with 30,
Artycas with 50, Arbianes with 22, Artaeus with 40,
Artynes with 22, Astibaras with 40, and finally Aspadas
with 38 years. On this calculation the dominion of
the Median kings lasted 320 years, and consequently
Arbaces must have overthrown the Assyrian and
established the Median Empire in the year 878
<small>B.C.</small>; or as Ctesias puts the fall of the last Median
king in 564, and not in 550 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;in the year 884 <small>B.C.</small><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
precisely at the time when Assyria began to
rise into the position of a widely dominant power
(III. 269, 270). In the list of kings given by Ctesias
Mandaces and Artycas each rule fifty years, Arbianes
and Artynes 22 years, Artaeus and Astibaras 40 years.
This uniformity points to an artificial extension of the
series by duplicates.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> If it is reduced by striking
out the three seconds in these pairs, and Arbaces is
followed by Mandaces with 50 years, Sosarmus with
30 years, Arbianes with 22 years, Artaeus with 40
years, and Aspadas with 38 years, we obtain a period
of 178 years for the kings of the Medes, and so
arrive at a point nearer that given by Herodotus for
the commencement of the Median kingdom, the year
736 <small>B.C.</small> (558 + 178), as the first year of Arbaces. Yet
even so we do not find any coincidence whatever
between the two narratives.</p>

<p>In the narrative of Herodotus we find with surprise
that the Medes attained their liberation without any
combination in the people; without the leadership of
a single head. Yet soon after the time at which he
describes the Medes as revolting from the Assyrians,
Herodotus tells us that Sennacherib marched against
Egypt, and asserts that for 75 years after the accession
of Deioces, "the Assyrians were indeed without
allies, since they had revolted, but were otherwise in a
good condition," so that Phraortes and the greatest
part of his army fell in battle against them. If after
acquiring their freedom the Medes lived isolated in
villages, as Herodotus states, would not the Assyrians
have made use of this anarchy close upon their borders
in order to reduce the Medes again to subjection,
rather than engage in campaigns against Syria and
Egypt? According to the account of Herodotus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
it was the justice of Deioces which won for him
ever-increasing importance, and finally helped him
to the throne. But had Deioces, who sits on the
throne for 53 years afterwards, sufficient time before
his elevation to make himself known for his love of
justice throughout all Media, unless we are willing to
assign him a very unusual age?<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> And if such dire
anarchy did indeed prevail among the Medes, what
man in such times submits to even the most righteous
sentence? Least of all are the mighty and powerful
willing to do so. How did Deioces obtain the means of
compelling the insubordinate to obey his sentence?&mdash;how
could he give protection to the accused, oppressed,
and weak against their opponents? And supposing
that he was able to do this, would he have been
unanimously elected king? Herodotus himself remarks
that Deioces knew that "the unjust are the
enemies of the just."<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Moreover, if the Medes at that
time lived in the simplest manner, how could a
sovereign elected from their midst change these conditions
at a single stroke, or at any rate in the course of
a single reign, though a long one, so entirely as Herodotus
supposes? Village life is changed into city life,
the Medes are settled in one city round the royal
fortress, and in the place of a patriarchal government
over a simple people, Deioces, "as the first," establishes
the whole apparatus of Oriental tyranny. Immense
palaces, citadels, and walls are built; the wide outer
walls are adorned with gold and silver; the secluded
life of the sovereign in the palace becomes the established
law; the legal process is carried on by writing;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
and a system of espionage is introduced over the whole
country. It is obvious that in this narrative elements,
belonging to the tradition of the Medes, have been
taken by Herodotus and mingled with the views of the
Greeks, who were familiar with the combination of
villages into one canton, and the union of hamlets
into a city, and had experience of the establishment of
a monarchy by setting up a tyranny in consequence of
the services rendered by the aspirant to the multitude.
Herodotus expressly calls the dominion of Deioces
a tyranny. It is a fact beyond dispute that Herodotus
was influenced by such conceptions in shaping
and forming the material which came to him from
tradition.</p>

<p>Apart from the motives which influenced him in
describing the elevation of Deioces, Herodotus wishes
to show how the nations of Asia obtained their freedom,
and subsequently lost it. He begins with the statement,
that the Medes revolted from Assyria, and all
the nations of Asia followed their example. According
to his dates, which have been already mentioned, the
Medes must have revolted precisely at the time when
Tiglath Pilesar II. and Sargon reigned over Assyria,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the period between 745 and 705 <small>B.C.</small> The
liberation of the remaining nations must therefore have
taken place under Sargon or his successors, Sennacherib
and Esarhaddon, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> between the year 705
and 668 <small>B.C.</small> That this general liberation from the
sovereignty of the Assyrians did not take place at
this period is abundantly clear from the inscriptions
of the kings and the Hebrew Scriptures. We have seen
above to what an extent Tiglath Pilesar caused the
whole of Syria to feel the weight of the Assyrian
arms; he reduced Babylonia to dependence as far as
the Persian Gulf; Sargon was sovereign of Babylonia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
maintained Syria, and received the homage of the
island of Cyprus, and the islands of the Persian Gulf.
His successor, Sennacherib, though unable to protect
Syria against Egypt, yet retained Babylonia and the
eastern half of Asia Minor under his dominion. Esarhaddon
united the crowns of Asshur and Babel,
restored the supremacy of Assyria over Syria, subjugated
a part of Arabia and the whole of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
Hence it is clear, that precisely at the time when,
according to Herodotus, the rest of the nations following
the example of the Medes threw off the Assyrian
yoke, that kingdom reached a wider extent than at any
previous time. If, nevertheless, we wish to maintain
the statement that the rest of the nations followed the
example which the Medes are supposed to have set
about the year 736 <small>B.C.</small>,<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> we must place these events
in the last decade of the reign of Assurbanipal, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in
the period between 636 and 626 <small>B.C.</small> We must therefore
bring them down a full century, and this was a
very late result of the action of the Medes.</p>

<p>Let us attempt, by a comparison of the statements
of the Assyrian inscriptions on the events which
took place on the table-land of Iran and the narrative
of Herodotus, to ascertain the real facts of the
liberation of the Medes. We saw above (p. 19) that
Shalmanesar II. of Asshur (859-823 <small>B.C.</small>) carried his
campaigns as far as the East of Iran. In the year
835 <small>B.C.</small> he imposed tribute on twenty-seven princes
of the land of Parsua, and "turned against the plains
of the land of Amadai;" in 830 <small>B.C.</small> his general-in-chief,
Dayan Asshur, went down into the land of
Parsua, and laid tribute on the land of Parsua, "which
did not worship Asshur," obtained possession of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
cities, and sent their people and treasures into the
land of Assyria.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Tiglath Pilesar II. (745-727 <small>B.C.</small>),
in the campaign which carried him to Arachosia, subjugated
"the land of Nisaa" and "the cities of the
land of Media (Madai)." In the following year he
occupied "the land of Parsua;" "Zikruti in rugged
Media, I added to the land of Assyria; I received the
tribute of Media;" and on his ninth campaign he
again marched into "the land of Media." In an
inscription which sums up all his achievements, he
declares that he has imposed tribute "on the land of
Parsua," the city of Zikruti, "which depends on the
land of the Medes," and on the chieftains of "the land
of Media."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> The books of the Hebrews tell us that
after the fall of Samaria in 721 <small>B.C.</small> "the king of
Assyria carried Israel away, and gave them habitations
in Chalah, and in the cities of the Medes." It
was Sargon (722-705 <small>B.C.</small>) to whom Samaria yielded.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>
His inscriptions also tell us that he carried away the
inhabitants of Samaria, and they make mention of the
cities of the Medes. According to them, he received
heavy tribute from twenty-five chiefs of the Medes in
the year 716 <small>B.C.</small>, and set up his royal image in the
midst of their cities. In the next year he carried
away captive "Dayauku with his people and his
family, and caused him to dwell in the land of Amat,"
built fortresses in order to control Media, received
tribute from twenty-two chiefs of the Medes, conquered
thirty-four cities in Media, and united them with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Assyria. In the year 713 <small>B.C.</small> he marched against
Bit Dayauku, reduced the chief districts of Media,
which had cast off the yoke of Assyria, and received
tribute from forty-five Median chiefs; 4609 horses,
asses, and sheep in great abundance. Sargon repeatedly
boasts that "he has reduced the distant land of Media,
all the places of distant Media, as far as the borders
of the land of Bikni; that he brought them under the
dominion of Asshur; and that his power extended as
far as the city of Simaspati, which belonged to distant
Media in the East."<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> The inscriptions of his successor
Sennacherib (705-681 <small>B.C.</small>) tell us that on his return
from his second campaign (against the land of Ellip),
he received the heavy tribute of the distant land of
Media, and subjugated the land to his dominion.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
Esarhaddon (681-668 <small>B.C.</small>), the successor of Sennacherib,
according to the Hebrew Scriptures, deported
people from Persia to Samaria. He tells us himself:
"The land of Patusarra, a district in the region of
&mdash;&mdash;, in the midst of distant Media, on the border of
the land of Bikni, the copper mountains. None of
the kings my forefathers had subjugated this land.
Sitirparna and Iparna, the chiefs of the fortified
places, had not bowed before me. I carried them
away with their subjects, horses, chariots, oxen, sheep,
asses, as rich booty to Assyria." "The chiefs of the
cities of Partakka, Partukka, and Uraka-zabarna, in
the land of Media, who lay far off, and in the days
of the kings my forefathers had not trodden the soil
of Assyria&mdash;them the fear of Asshur, my lord, threw
to the ground; they brought for me, to my city
Nineveh, their great animals, copper, the product of
their mines, bowed themselves with folded hands
before me, and besought my favour. I put my viceroys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
over them, who united the inhabitants of these
regions with my kingdom; I imposed services upon
them, and a fixed tribute."<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> The period at which
this tribute was imposed on the most distant part of
Media can only be so far fixed that it must lie
between 681 and 673 <small>B.C.</small> Assurbanipal, who succeeded
Esarhaddon (668-626 <small>B.C.</small>), tells us: "I
captured Birizchadri, the warden of the city of
Madai (?); Sariti and Pariza, the sons of Gagi, the
warden of the cities of the land of Sakhi, and 75
citadels had cast off the yoke of my dominion; I took
the cities; the chiefs fell alive into my hands; I
sent them to Nineveh my metropolis." These events
belong to the period between the years 660 and
650 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>To weaken the contradiction between this series of
statements and the narrative of Herodotus, we may
call to mind the gross exaggerations in which the kings
of Assyria indulge in describing their acts and successes,
and the grandiloquence which we have already
noticed more than once in the statements of Assyrian
history (III. 139, 200). But however great or however
small may have been the success of the campaigns
of Tiglath Pilesar II., Sargon, Sennacherib,
Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal against the chiefs of
the Medes, it cannot be denied that these campaigns
took place. And if from the very frequency of such
campaigns, after the reign of Tiglath Pilesar, we are
inclined to draw the conclusion that they are a proof
of the lax and nominal character of the dominion of
Assyria over Media, this conclusion proves too much.
The same repetition of warlike enterprises on the part
of the kings of Asshur takes place, as we saw, in every
direction. We shall have as much right to conclude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
that there was no such thing as an Assyrian empire,
either before the year 736 or after it, over the Medes
or any other nation. As I have shown (III. 185), the
Assyrian kingdom never acquired a firm dominion
over the subjugated nations, still less an organisation
of the empire, like the subsequent kingdom of the
Ach&aelig;menids. Their sovereignty consisted almost exclusively
in the collection of tribute by force of arms,
in the subjugation or removal of the princes who
refused it, and setting up of others, who in turn soon
withheld it. At the most, Assyrian fortresses were
planted here and there; and no doubt Assyrian viceroys
were placed over smaller regions. The same
procedure is seen in the inscriptions as in use
towards the Medes; and if this is not regarded as the
sovereignty of Assyria, no such sovereignty existed
before Tiglath Pilesar. If, to meet this objection, the
existence of an Assyrian dominion is allowed, in the
very lax form which is everywhere characteristic of
it, we may, from the same frequency of the campaigns
against Media, draw the opposite conclusion, that the
Medes had struggled very vigorously for freedom,
that in the first place the most remote tribes acquired
it, and for them the liberation gradually spread, and
the tradition of the Medes has accepted the beginning
of the movement as the completion of it.</p>

<p>Setting aside any conclusions of this kind, even
tradition can only have regarded the beginning of the
struggle for freedom as the beginning of liberation, if
it covered the nucleus of a firm resistance, either in
some definite district, or in a dynasty which took
the lead in the struggle and carried it on. Herodotus
is not acquainted with any leader in the struggle and
does not mention any, while the campaigns of the
Assyrians are always directed against a greater or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
less number of princes and cities; sometimes they
fall on this chieftain and sometimes on that.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> If,
moreover, the fact that Sargon receives tribute from
twenty-five, then from twenty-two, and then from
forty-five chieftains, is brought forward to confirm
the narratives of Herodotus about the anarchy which
prevailed among the Medes, it is not the separation
of the Medes under different chiefs which constitutes
the anarchy as described by Herodotus, but
actual lawlessness. His description gives us no chieftains
in Media, ruling their lands as captains in war
and judges in peace. The Medes dwell in villages,
and the inhabitants choose the village judge, though it
is in their power to go for decision to another village.
Chieftains, even if they had not forbidden their tribes
to seek for justice out of the tribe, would in any case
have left the decision of Deioces unnoticed.</p>

<p>However this may be, one harsh contradiction between
the narrative of Herodotus and the inscriptions
cannot be removed by any exposition or any deductions.
According to Herodotus Deioces reigned
from the year 708 to 655 <small>B.C.</small>, Phraortes from 655
to 633 <small>B.C.</small>, over the whole of Media. The inscriptions
of Sennacherib mention the great payment of tribute
by the distant land of Media, and its subjugation
under Sennacherib (p. 282); Esarhaddon removes two
chieftains with their flocks and subjects out of Media
from the border of the land of Bikni to Asshur, and
three chiefs from the same district bring their tribute
to Nineveh; he places his viceroys over them, and
they unite this district with Assyria. After the year<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
660 <small>B.C.</small> Assurbanipal is said to have taken a chieftain
of Media captive; and in the inscriptions there
is nowhere any mention of Deioces, Phraortes, and the
Median kingdom.</p>

<p>The inscriptions extend the land of the Medes to
the East as far as the copper mountains, or borders of
the land of Bikni.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The people lived separately under
a considerable number of chieftains. The five tribes
of the Median nation, enumerated by Herodotus, if
they also possessed separate territory, were not isolated
groups, but on the contrary broken up into yet smaller
divisions. The booty taken by the Assyrians from
the Medes, the tribute imposed upon them, consists
chiefly in oxen, asses, sheep, and horses. The number
of horses given by the chieftains to Sargon allows on
an average a hundred for each, and we also hear of
other property, treasures, and the product of copper
mines. We have repeated mention of the cities of
Media and their governors; Sargon conquers thirty-four
cities. Though we ought to regard these mainly
as citadels, yet civic life cannot have been so unknown
to the Medes as the narrative of Herodotus would
compel us to suppose. Other elements of civilisation
also are known to the Medes at this time, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the
second half of the eighth and first half of the seventh
century <small>B.C.</small> It has been proved above that at the
beginning of this period the doctrine of Zoroaster must
have reached them, and the names could be given of
the men in Media who published it; and the priests
of the new religion became formed during this century
into an order which perpetuated in their families the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
knowledge of the good sayings and the customs of
sacrifice. To this order we may also attribute what
the Medes acquired of the superior civilisation and
skill of Assyria, especially the knowledge of the
Assyrian cuneiform writing, which underwent a change
in the hands of the Magians, and assumed the form
known to us from the Ach&aelig;menid inscriptions of the
first class. When Herodotus ascribes the introduction
of written process at law to Deioces, the tradition presupposes
an established and extensive use of writing.</p>

<p>The dominion of the princes under which the Medes
stood is followed by the dominion of the monarchy,
which must have arisen out of it. One of the families
of these princes must have succeeded in obtaining
influence and power over the others. The position of
Deioces and Phraortes must have arisen and developed
itself in this manner. Whether the Dayauku, whom
Sargon carried off in the year 715 <small>B.C.</small> with his followers
to Amat, is one and the same person with the
prince of Bit Dayauku, against whom the Assyrian
king marched in the year 713 <small>B.C.</small> (p. 282), would
be difficult to decide; and even if the matter could be
determined with certainty, it would not be of great
importance. We often find the kings of Asshur replacing
conquered and captive princes in their dominions.
On the other hand, it is of importance that there was
a region of Media, which could be called Bit Dayauku,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the land of Dayauku, by the Assyrians in the
year 713 <small>B.C.</small> There must have existed at this time
a principality of Deioces among other principalities,
and the beginning of this must be put earlier than
the date allowed by Herodotus for the election, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
at the latest at 720 <small>B.C.</small> In course of time the land
of Deioces may have increased in extent, and the
importance of the ruler may have grown&mdash;though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
he may not, after the conflict of 713 <small>B.C.</small>, have taken
any leading part in the resistance to the payment of
tribute, the conflicts and successes of other chieftains
against the Assyrians; at any rate, there is no subsequent
mention of the land in the inscriptions. Neither
Deioces nor his land is mentioned when Sennacherib
speaks of the tribute of the whole of Media, and the
subjugation of the country under his dominion; nor
even when Esarhaddon speaks of the conquest of the
most distant princes. Hence we can only grant to
the narrative of Herodotus that, in the times of Sennacherib
and Esarhaddon, Deioces, the son of Phraortes,
had a considerable territory among the chiefs of
the Medes, and greater importance than others, and
we have no reason to look for his dominion elsewhere
than at Ecbatana. His son Phraortes (Fravartis), who
according to Herodotus came to the throne in the year
655 <small>B.C.</small>, must have succeeded in uniting the chiefs of
the Medes under his sway, and combining with the
tribes of the Persians, among whom at that time the
race of the Ach&aelig;menids had acquired a prominent
position,<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> in order to maintain their independence
against Assyria.</p>

<p>From this point downwards we can date the union
and independence of Media. Had the country been
free and united at the time of Sargon, Sennacherib,
and Esarhaddon, the rulers of Assyria would not have
marched against Syria and Cilicia, or undertaken
the conquest of Egypt. Assurbanipal could not have
employed the forces of the kingdom to maintain
Egypt, or reduce Babylon, or annihilate Edom, or
make campaigns to the distant parts of Arabia, if the
united power of Media had existed behind the Zagrus,
close on the borders of his native land, the very centre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
of the Assyrian power. Still less could he have looked
on in inaction, while Phraortes, as Herodotus tells
us, conquered the Persians, and attacked one nation
after another till he had subjugated Asia. On the
other hand, the annihilation of Elam by Assurbanipal,
and consequent strengthening of the Assyrian power
on the borders of Persia, may well have determined
the Persians to unite with the Medes, and accept a
position under Phraortes.</p>

<p>In considering the situation and importance of the
powers, we may assume that Phraortes, in the first
instance, thought rather of defence than of any attack
on Assyria, and for this object undertook the fortification
of Ecbatana on a large scale. What could have
induced him to abandon the protecting line of the
Zagrus, in order to attack under the massive walls of
its metropolis the power which had just dealt such
heavy and destructive blows on ancient states like
Babylonia and Elam, unless we attribute to him the
most reckless audacity? Nor, on the other hand, can
we suppose that an ancient ruler like Assurbanipal,
who had held his own successfully against the searching
attack of his brother, and finally gained important
conquests, would have allowed the formation of
the Median power in the closest proximity, and its
combination with the Persians, without the least
attempt to prevent it. It was in repulsing this attack
that Phraortes fell.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>If this inquiry leads us to attribute to Phraortes the
foundation of a consolidated government, the establish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>ment
of monarchy in Media, the union of the Persians
and Medes, and the subordination of the former to
Phraortes, we can yet understand that the traditions of
the Medes, anxious to increase the glory of the country,
threw the monarchy further back, ascribed to Deioces,
the father of Phraortes, the consolidation of Media,
and represented the liberation from the sway of
Assyria as prior to the foundation of the monarchy.
What Median poems can do for the glorification of
their country, even in the teeth of the established
facts of history, will soon become even more clear.
How this tradition explained the elevation of Deioces
we cannot now discover; it is clear that Herodotus
gives a Greek turn to this part of the story (p. 280).
And if tradition ascribes to Deioces the extensive and
strong fortifications of Ecbatana, which more correctly
belong to Phraortes and his successors, it is Herodotus
who credits him with the discovery of the mode of life
usual among Oriental monarchs. The Medo-Persian
Epos shows us the successors of Semiramis in the
seclusion of the palace. On the other hand, the
Median tradition must have ascribed the reduction of
Asia to Phraortes. We have already remarked (III.
280), that towards the close of the sixth century <small>B.C.</small>
Cyaxares and not Phraortes was regarded by the nation
as the founder of the power and greatness of Media.
Herodotus himself tells us "that Cyaxares was far
more powerful than his predecessors." Hence the
later legend, which Herodotus reproduces, ascribed the
foundation to Phraortes, and the extension of the
Median power to Cyaxares. But if Phraortes was to
be the conqueror of Asia, he must "when he had
attacked and conquered the other nations one after
the other," have finally marched against the Assyrians,
against whom he did in fact contend.</p>

the Medes. This hypothesis contradicts everything that has come
down to us of Median names and works, and the close relationship

into Media, found there Turkish-Tatar tribes, overpowered, expelled
or subjugated them, is another question. If this were the

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE EMPIRE OF THE MEDES.</h3>


<p>"When Phraortes had fallen, he was succeeded by his
son Cyaxares. This prince collected all his subjects
and marched against Nineveh, in order to avenge the
death of his father and destroy the city. He defeated
the Assyrians, and while encamped before Nineveh,
there came upon him the vast army of the Scythians,
led by their king Madyas, the son of Protothyas,
who invaded Asia in pursuit of the Cimmerians, and
as they did not come through the land of the Saspeires,
but kept the Caucasus to the right, they
reached the Median country. Here they attacked the
Medes, and the latter being conquered in the battle
lost their empire; the Scythians became masters of
the whole of Asia, and ruled over it for 28 years.
With reckless cruelty they laid everything waste;
they not only imposed tribute on all the nations, but
went round and took from every one all that he
possessed. But Cyaxares and the Medes massacred
the greater part of them after making them intoxicated
at a banquet, and in this way the Medes recovered
their empire, and again governed those who
had previously been subject to them. Then a horde
of Scythians, which had separated from the rest and
put themselves under the protection of Cyaxares, were
guilty of a crime against a Median boy who had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
entrusted to them, and fled for refuge to Alyattes, king
of Lydia, who refused to give them up. This led to
a war between Media and Lydia which continued for
five years, and was brought to an end by a treaty in
which Alyattes gave his daughter Aryanis to wife
to the son of Cyaxares. Cyaxares was master of all
Asia beyond the Halys, took Nineveh, and subjugated
the Assyrians, with the exception of the Babylonian
portion." Such is the history, given by Herodotus,
of Cyaxares, who, on his reckoning, ascended the
throne of Media in the year 633 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>If Phraortes had fallen in battle against the
Assyrians with the greater part of his army, Cyaxares
(Uvakshathra) could hardly have at once undertaken
an attack on Nineveh, with a view of avenging his
father's death by the destruction of that city; his
first care, on the contrary, would have been to prevent
the Assyrians from making use of their great victory,
to guard against further advances on their part, and
to maintain the freedom of Media. This struggle
Cyaxares passed through with success; that his good
fortune carried him as far as the walls of Nineveh,
is indeed possible, but not probable; according to
Herodotus the collision of the Scythians and Medes
did not take place in the land of Asshur, but further
to the East, in Media.</p>

<p>The facts about the pursuit of the Cimmerians and
the invasion of the Scythians have been already examined,
and it has been shown that Herodotus has
connected the immigration of the Cimmerians into
Asia Minor, which took place in the eighth century
<small>B.C.</small>, with the incursion of Sacian tribes from the Oxus
into Media, about the year 630 <small>B.C.</small> He was deceived
by the circumstance that the Cimmerians from their
abode on the lower Halys penetrated to Sardis and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
the cities of the Western coast, about the time when
the Sac&aelig; invaded Media and inundated Hither Asia
(III. 276). The truth is that the hordes of the Sac&aelig;
not only overthrew Media, but passed through Mesopotamia
into Syria as far as the borders of Egypt.
Their attack shattered and destroyed the cohesion of
the Assyrian empire.</p>

<p>About the year 620 Cyaxares succeeded in overpowering
the section of the Scythians which remained
in Media (these hordes were no doubt widely dispersed),
and again became master in his own dominions.
He made use of his advantageous position as the
first who could again direct the forces of his people.
He showed himself to the Armenians and Cappadocians
as a champion to defend them from the plundering
Scythians, and at the same time aided in liberating
them from the dominion of the Assyrians. The incursion
of the Scythians had prepared the way for
him; in a few years he was able to extend his power
to the West as far as the Halys.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> Nabopolassar, the
viceroy of Assyria in Babylon, who had determined to
turn to account the severe blow which the incursion
of the Scyths had given to the Assyrian kingdom, had
already offered him his hand in alliance. Amyite, the
daughter of Cyaxares, had become the wife of Nebuchadnezzar,
the son of Nabopolassar. But in Asia Minor,
far to the West, the princes of the Lydians had taken
advantage of the disturbance and confusion which the
advance of the Cimmerians had carried to the Western
coast, to extend their power over Phrygia as far as the
Halys (III. 435). Here the two rapidly-developing
powers met. Though inferior in numbers the Lydians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
showed themselves a match for the Medes. After a
war of five years, peace was established between them
by Nabopolassar of Babylon and Syennesis of Cilicia,
in order to set the power of Media free to act against
Nineveh. The Halys became the boundary of the
two kingdoms, and the peace was confirmed by an
alliance. Alyattes of Lydia gave his daughter Aryanis
to wife to Astyages the son of Cyaxares (610 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>).
Media and Babylonia now thought themselves strong
enough to undertake the contest against the remains
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>of the Assyrian kingdom. Cyaxares led out the
Medes, Nabopolassar the Babylonians against king
Assur-idil-ili. The latter offered a long and stubborn
defence, and when at length the walls of Nineveh were
broken through, he burnt himself in the citadel. The
Assyrian country as far as the Tigris fell to the share
of Media; Mesopotamia was united with the new
kingdom of Babylon (607 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>). Thus Media and
Babylonia took the place of Assyria; and Babylon, as
Herodotus says, was now the chief city of the
Assyrians.</p>

<p>When the kingdom had fallen which for three
centuries had ruled in the East and West, Cyaxares
might indulge the thought of making his empire more
complete on the table-land of Iran. According to
the story which Ctesias has preserved for us from the
Medo-Persian Epos of the fall of Assyria (III. 249),
the Bactrians had been prevailed upon to join the
Medes and Babylonians in the course of the war
against Assyria, and the Persian songs which describe
the contest of Cyrus and Astyages, represent the
Hyrcanians, Parthians, Bactrians, and other nations of
the East, as ruled by viceroys of the Median king.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
We may regard it as certain that Cyaxares succeeded
in subjugating the table-land of Iran to a considerable
extent. No slight proof is afforded of the increase
and greatness of the Median kingdom in his reign by
the unusual care and extraordinary efforts of the
successor of Nabopolassar to protect Babylonia and
Babylon by fortifications against the event of a
struggle between the two powers, whose united
exertions had destroyed Assyria (III. 366).</p>

<p>The position which the Medo-Persian poems assign
to the chief of the Babylonians beside the chief of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
the Medes, during and after the common struggle,
has been already explained. The Babylonian is the
astrologer, the adviser, the helper; the Mede is the
man of action. In the event of success against
Assyria he promises the Babylonian the viceroyalty of
Babylon, and has already given it to him, free of
tribute, when the fraud is discovered by which the
cunning Babylonian has acquired the most valuable
part of the spoil of Nineveh. For this offence the
chief is condemned to death; but the Mede pardons
him, and in consideration of his former services and the
promise made, leaves him the viceroyalty. So eager
were the Median minstrels to conceal the independence
of Babylonia beside Media, and represent a power as
great as Babylon was under Nebuchadnezzar as a
satrapy of their kings. This fiction is maintained in
other episodes of the Medo-Persian Epos which have
come down to us. We are told of the stubborn
resistance which the Cadusians made to the Medes;
and an explanation is given how this unimportant
nation on the shore of the Caspian (p. 268) could
withstand the mighty kingdom of the Medes. This
episode has come to us in the Persian form. It is the
fault of the Median king that the Cadusians have become
stubborn and successful enemies. He failed to
help to his rights a brave warrior in his service; this
warrior betook himself to the Cadusians, and became
their chief, led them well, and bequeathed his thirst
for vengeance to his descendants. From such a point
of view even a Median minstrel could lament the
perversity of the Median king, and the power of Babylonian
gold, the abundance of which is strongly marked
in the narrative, could praise the ancient simplicity of
the Medes: "who took no heed of silver, and did not
regard gold," as we are told in the Hebrew Scriptures,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
and reprobate the victory of gold over strict justice.
But it is a Persian to whom the wrong is done, who
summons the Cadusians to freedom; and the resistance
of the Cadusians to the Median kingdom, thus
brought about by a Persian, subsequently furnishes
Cyrus with a pretext for arming the Persians, and
also provides him with allies in the Cadusians. It was
the merit of a brave Persian to have provided this
assistance for his people long before. The king of
the Medes who was guilty of this mistake is called
in Ctesias Artaeus; we have seen (p. 277) that
Artaeus and Astibaras, who reigned 40 years each, are
but one and the same person; and as the reign of
Cyaxares occupies 40 years in Herodotus, we may
conjecture that he is the king hidden behind the
Artaeus-Astibaras of Ctesias. The king of Babylon,
the satrap of the episode, is brought in as a descendant
of Belesys (Nabopolassar), and described as an
effeminate man. His name, in the form given by
Ctesias, is Annarus. Evilmerodach or Neriglissar of
Babylon must be meant; but, without doubt, we are
dealing with mere fiction.</p>

<p>The episode is as follows: There was a Persian of
the name of Parsondes, in the service of the king of the
Medes, an eager huntsman, and active warrior on foot
and in the chariot, distinguished in council and in the
field, and of influence with the king. Parsondes often
urged the king to make him satrap of Babylon in
the place of Annarus, who wore women's clothes and
ornaments, but the king always put the petition aside,
for it could not be granted without breaking the
promise which his ancestor had made to Belesys
(p. 297). Annarus discovered the intentions of Parsondes,
and sought to secure himself against him, and
to take vengeance. He promised great rewards to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
cooks who were in the train of the king, if they succeeded
in seizing Parsondes and giving him up. One
day Parsondes in the heat of the chase strayed far
from the king. He had already killed many boars
and deer, when the pursuit of a wild ass (the Sassanids
also hunt this animal) carried him to a great
distance. At last he came upon the cooks, who were
occupied in preparations for the king's table. Being
thirsty, Parsondes asked for wine; they gave it, took
care of his horse, and invited him to take food&mdash;an
invitation agreeable to Parsondes, who had been hunting
the whole day. He bade them send the ass
which he had captured to the king, and tell his own
servants where he was. Then he ate of the various
kinds of food set before him, and drank abundantly of
the excellent wine, and at last asked for his horse in
order to return to the king. But they brought beautiful
women to him, and urged him to remain for
the night. He agreed, and as soon as, overcome by
hunting, wine, and love he had fallen into a deep sleep,
the cooks bound him, and brought him to Annarus.
Annarus reproached him with calling him an effeminate
man, and seeking to obtain his satrapy; he had
the king to thank that the satrapy granted to his
ancestors had not been taken from him. Parsondes
replied that he considered himself more worthy of the
office, because he was more manly and more useful
to the king. But Annarus swore by Bel and Mylitta
that Parsondes should be softer and whiter than
a woman, called for the eunuch who was over the
female players, and bade him shave the body of
Parsondes and bathe and anoint him every day,
put women's clothes on him, plait his hair after
the manner of women, paint his face, and place
him among the women, who played the guitar and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
sang, and to teach him their arts. This was done, and
soon Parsondes played and sang better at the table of
Annarus than any of the women. Meanwhile the
king of the Medes had caused search to be made
everywhere for Parsondes, and since he could nowhere
be found, and nothing could be heard of him,
he believed that a lion or some other wild animal
had torn him when out hunting, and lamented for his
loss. Parsondes had lived for seven years as a woman
in Babylon, when Annarus caused an eunuch to
be scourged and grievously maltreated. This eunuch
Parsondes induced by large presents to retire to
Media and tell the king the misfortune which had
come upon him. Then the king sent a message commanding
Annarus to give up Parsondes. Annarus
declared that he had never seen him. But the
king sent a second messenger charging him to bring
Annarus to be put to death if he did not surrender
Parsondes. Annarus entertained the messenger of
the king, and when the meal was brought, 150
women entered, of whom some played the guitar
while others blew the flute. At the end of the meal
Annarus asked the king's envoy which of all the
women was the most beautiful and had played best.
The envoy pointed to Parsondes. Annarus laughed
long and said, "That is the person whom you seek,"
and released Parsondes, who on the next day returned
home with the envoy to the king in a chariot. The
king was astonished at the sight of him, and asked
why he had not avoided such disgrace by death?
Parsondes answered: "In order that I might see you
again, and by you execute vengeance on Annarus,
which could never have been mine had I taken my
life." The king promised him that his hope should
not be deceived, as soon as he came to Babylon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
But when he came there, Annarus defended himself
on the ground that Parsondes, though in no way
injured by him, had maligned him, and sought to
obtain the satrapy over Babylonia. The king pointed
out that he had made himself judge in his own
cause, and had imposed a punishment of a degrading
character; in ten days he would pronounce sentence
upon him for his conduct. In terror Annarus hastened
to Mitraphernes, the eunuch of greatest influence
with the king, and promised him the most liberal
rewards (10 talents of gold and 100 talents of silver,
10 golden and 200 silver bowls) if he could induce
the king to spare his life and retain him in the satrapy
of Babylonia. He was prepared to give the king 100
talents of gold, 1000 talents of silver, 100 golden
and 300 silver bowls, and costly robes with other
gifts; Parsondes also should receive 100 talents of
silver and costly robes. After many entreaties Mitraphernes
persuaded the king not to command the
execution of Annarus, as he had not killed Parsondes,
but to condemn him in the penalty which
he was prepared to pay Parsondes and the king.
Annarus in gratitude threw himself at the feet of
the king, but Parsondes said: "Cursed be the man
who first brought gold among men; for the sake
of gold I have been made a mockery to the Babylonians."
The eunuch advised him to lay aside his
anger, and be reconciled with Annarus, for that was
what the king desired; but Parsondes determined to
take vengeance for the sentence of the king, and
waited for a favourable opportunity in order to fly
with a thousand horse and three thousand infantry
to the Cadusians, whose most distinguished chief had
married his sister. Then he persuaded the Cadusians
to revolt from the Medes, and was elected to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
their general. When the king of the Medes armed
against them, Parsondes armed in return, and occupied
the passes into the country with 200,000 warriors.
Though the Median king brought up 800,000 men,
Parsondes nevertheless put him to flight, and slew
50,000 Medes. In admiration of such noble deeds,
the Cadusians made Parsondes king, and they often
invaded Media and laid it waste. At the end of his
days, Parsondes commanded his successor to remain
an enemy of the Medes, and pronounced a curse: "If
ever peace should be concluded between the Medes
and the Cadusians, might his race and the whole
nation of the Cadusians perish." This is the reason
why the Cadusians remained the enemies of the
Medes, and were never subject to them.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>Another episode tells us of the contests which the
Medes had to sustain under the dominion of Astibaras-Artaeus,
<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of Cyaxares, against the Parthians
and the Sac&aelig;. The Parthians, whose chief was
Marmares, revolted from the Medes, but handed over
their land and city to the king of the Sac&aelig;, Cydraeus,
that he might protect them against the Medes; and
the sister of Cydraeus, Zarinaea (Zaranya, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
golden), who was distinguished for her beauty and
wisdom, her boldness and bravery (for the women of
the Sac&aelig; took the field with the men), became the wife
of Marmares. As the Medians intended to reduce the
Parthians again to subjection, a war broke out between
them and the Parthians and Sac&aelig;, which lasted for
several years, and led to battles in which many fell
on one side and the other. In one of these battles
Zarinaea was wounded. Stryangaeus, the Mede, to
whom Cyaxares had given his daughter Rhoet&aelig;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
to wife, pursued, overtook, and threw her from her
horse. But the sight of her beauty and youth, and
her entreaties, moved him; he allowed her to escape.
Not long afterwards Stryangaeus with other Medes
was taken captive by the Parthians. Marmares wished
to put him to death, and though Zarinaea entreated
for his life, insisted on his execution. Then Zarinaea
loosed the bonds of the captive Medes, caused Marmares
to be put to death by them, and allowed
Stryangaeus to escape. When, after the death of her
brother Cydraeus, she ascended the throne of the Sac&aelig;,
she sent messengers to the king of the Medes to
conclude peace and friendship. The Parthians were
to return under the sovereignty of the Medes, the
Sac&aelig; and Medes were to keep what previously belonged
to them, and to be friends and allies for ever.
This was done. Stryangaeus, the real author of this
treaty, ever since the battle in which he had first seen
Zarinaea, had been possessed with violent love for
her, and went to Roxanace (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the brilliant),<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> where
was the royal citadel of the Sac&aelig;, in order to see the
beloved princess once more. Zarinaea, who returned
his affection, came to see him full of joy, received him
and his attendants in the most splendid manner,
kissed him in the sight of all, and ascended his chariot,
and thus, while conversing with each other they
arrived in the palace. Here Stryangaeus sighed in
the chambers assigned to him, and could not resist the
violence of his passion. At length he took counsel
with the most faithful of his eunuchs, who encouraged
him to discover his passion to Zarinaea. Easily persuaded,
Stryangaeus hastened to the queen, and after
much delay and many sighs, sometimes blushing and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
again turning pale, he ventured to declare that he
was consumed with love for her. Zarinaea answered
quietly and gently that it would be shameful and
fatal for her to surrender herself to him, and far more
shameful and dangerous for Stryangaeus, as his wife
was the daughter of the king of the Medes, and, as
she heard, more beautiful than herself and many other
women. He must be brave, not only against his
enemies, but against himself, and not bring about a
long calamity for the sake of a brief enjoyment. No
other wish of his but this should remain unsatisfied.
Stryangaeus was silent for a long time, then embraced
and kissed the queen, and departed. He was far more
dejected than before, and determined to take his life.
"Thou hast been saved by me," he wrote to Zarinaea,
"but through thee I am destroyed. If in this thou
hast done justly, then may all good things be thine,
and mayest thou be happy; if thou hast done evil,
may a passion like mine overtake thee." When he
had bound the eunuch by an oath to give this letter
to Zarinaea immediately after his death, he lay back
on his cushions and demanded his sword. As the
eunuch refused to give it, he ended his days by
starvation. Zarinaea ruled over the Sac&aelig; with
wisdom and power. She conquered the neighbouring
nations who sought to subjugate her people,
caused a great part of the land to be cultivated, and
built a considerable number of cities, and brought
the Sac&aelig; into greater prosperity. In gratitude for
the benefits received from her, and in remembrance
of her virtues, the Sac&aelig; erected on her grave a three-sided
pyramid, three stades in length on each side,
and ending in a point a stadum in height, on which
was placed a colossal golden statue of the queen.
Worship was also offered to her as to a hero, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
that she received greater honours than any of her
predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>We have already acquainted ourselves with the land
of the Parthians (p. 10). The Sac&aelig; were neighbours
of the Hyrcanians, the Parthians, and the Bactrians
in the steppes of the Oxus. Herodotus tells us that
the Sac&aelig; were a nation of the tribe of the Scyths,
and that their proper name was Amyrgians; the Persians
called all the Scythians Sac&aelig;. The inscriptions
of Darius speak of &Ccedil;aka Humavarka; in the
second version the name is Omuvargap, and in the
Babylonian-Assyrian version Umurga. According to
the account of Herodotus the Sac&aelig; wore trousers,
and upright, pointed caps, and carried bows of a
peculiar character, battle-axes and daggers. They
fought as mounted bowmen. On the monument of
Darius at Behistun &Ccedil;akuka,<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> the leader of the Sac&aelig;,
wears a tall pointed cap. In the army of Xerxes the
Sac&aelig; were ranged with the Bactrians. What our
episode tells us of the royal citadel and the cities
built by Zarin&aelig;a does not harmonise with the nature
of the steppe-country of the Sac&aelig;, and the statement
of the Greeks, that the Sac&aelig; lived in variegated tents,
and that their wealth consisted in flocks of sheep, but
it does agree with the fact that the women went to
battle on horseback with the men. The companions
of Alexander describe the Sac&aelig; as strong, warlike,
well-grown men, with flowing hair; the Macedonians
only came up to their shoulders. Later accounts
speak of heavy-armed horse among them; both horse
and rider were covered with armour, and the weapons
of attack were long lances.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> From the narratives given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
in the episodes we may retain the fact that although
the Persians followed the lead of the Medes from
the time of Phraortes, Cyaxares, even after the fall of
Nineveh, did not succeed in subjugating the remaining
nations of Iran without severe struggles. There
is no reason to doubt that the Cadusians made an
obstinate resistance, and maintained their independence:
The Parthians were able to combine with the
Sac&aelig; in order to preserve their freedom, and did not
become subject to Cyaxares without severe contests.
That the Sagartians on the edge of the great desert
(p. 6) were subject to Cyaxares, is clear from the
inscription of Darius at Behistun. If the Medes
had to fight with the Sac&aelig;, who were settled on the
Oxus, Bactria must have been reduced to form a part
of their kingdom. Beside the Hyrcanians, Parthians,
and "other nations," the Bactrians and Sac&aelig; are
specially mentioned as subjects of the Median kings,<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>
and Arrian assures us that the A&ccedil;vakas, whom we
found north of the Cabul on the right bank of the
Indus (IV. 393), were subjects of the Medes.<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>Herodotus tells us that Cyaxares was the first to
separate the lance-bearers, archers, and horsemen, and
combine them into divisions; that is, he introduced a
better and more manageable arrangement of the army.
To the same prince, no doubt, is due the completion
of the fortifications of Ecbatana, which we found had
been strengthened by his predecessor Phraortes. When
the fortifications were first begun, the place was merely
intended as a point of defence against Assyria; but
as soon as it became destined to aid in the maintenance
of independence, it was necessary that it should
be capable of offering refuge and support to the
Median army, if hard pressed. The mountains of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
Zagrus form the boundary wall, and at the same time
the line of division between the Medes and Assyrians.
As Polybius told us (p. 268), it was an ascent of
twelve miles&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> four leagues&mdash;to the top of the
pass. If the Medes failed to hold these passes, and
were then defeated in their own table-land, the mountains
of the Orontes formed a new point of protection
to their retreat. The Orontes (Old Persian, <i>Urvanda</i>;
now Elvend) is a steep range of mountains, traversing
Media from north-west to south-east; the heights
of the passes are given by travellers at 7000 or
10,000 feet; Ctesias puts the ascent at twenty-five
stades;<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> recent explorers fix the time at four hours.
On the eastern spur of this mountain wall, in a
fertile plain, six leagues long and four leagues broad,
lay Ecbatana, Old Persian <i>Hangmatana, i.&nbsp;e.</i> place of
assembly, the Achmeta of the Hebrews. If the
Orontes could not be held, the fortifications of Ecbatana
formed a last point of protection for the Median army.
From the Assyrians there was nothing more to be
feared after the fall of Nineveh, but Cyaxares had
no doubt felt, in the inundation of Media by the
nomadic tribes of the Sac&aelig;, and then in the final
battles against Asshur, what a support was given
by a strong metropolis; what good service the walls
of Nineveh had rendered to the enemy, even in his
decline. He saw what measures were being taken
by Nebuchadnezzar, his step-son, to make his metropolis
secure, and determined that the kingdom, which
he had so rapidly and brilliantly erected and developed,
should not be without the nucleus of an
impregnable fortress and royal citadel. The booty in
silver and gold, which the Medes gained in Nineveh,
and of which we hear not in the Median poems only,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
but also from the Hebrew prophets who lived at the
time of the fall of the city, provided no doubt ample
means both for the erection of the strongest works,
and for the adornment of these as well as the citadel.</p>

<p>Ctesias tells us that Semiramis built a splendid
palace at Ecbatana, a city lying in a plain, and as
there were no springs near, she cut through the roots
of the range of mountains, twelve stades distant from
the city (the Orontes), on the farther side of which
was a lake flowing into a river, in order to convey the
water of the river into the city. For this object a
tunnel was cut through the mountain, fifteen feet in
breadth and forty feet in depth, and through it the
river was carried into Ecbatana.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> If Ctesias ascribes
the palace of Ecbatana and the tunnel, like other
monuments of Media, to Semiramis, we have already
seen that the queen is no more than a poetical fiction;
nor could any of the sovereigns who ruled over Assyria
entertain the project of building citadels and conduits
for the Median kings. These could only be the work
of Median princes, who resided in Ecbatana; and as
Phraortes could hardly have had the means and the
time for such important structures, we must ascribe
both the completion and adornment of the royal
citadel, as well as the tunnel, to Cyaxares, unless we
are to reject the latter as a pure invention, for which
there seems to me no sufficient proof.</p>

<p>"When the palace had been built at Ecbatana, it
was surrounded with large and strong walls," Herodotus
tells us, "of which one encircled another, in
such a manner that the inner overtopped the outer by
the height of the turret. The situation, which was
on a hill, contributed to this result, and the natural
elevation was artificially increased. In all there were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
seven circles; the innermost contained the king's
dwelling and treasure-house; the outermost wall was
of about the extent of the wall of Athens. The towers
of the first circle were white, of the second black, of the
third red-purple, of the fourth blue-purple, of the fifth
red; the towers of the sixth are covered with silver;
and those of the seventh, which surrounds the buildings
of the palace, with gold. The city was built round
the outermost wall."<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Polybius describes the situation
of Ecbatana and the palace as they were under the
Ach&aelig;menids, who were wont to pass some of the hot
summer months in the cool and fresh air of Ecbatana.
"Ecbatana lies in the northern regions of Media, and
commands the parts of Asia which look towards the
Maeotis and the Euxine. The city was in old days
the royal abode of the Median kings, and it appears
to have far surpassed all other cities in wealth and
in the splendour of its buildings. It is built under
the spurs of the Orontes. Though without walls, it
possesses a citadel built by the hand of man, of surprising
strength. Below the citadel is the palace,
which it is as difficult to speak of in detail as to pass
over in silence. Ecbatana is an excellent theme for
those who love to tell of marvellous things with adornment
and exaggeration; but those who enter with
caution on anything which goes beyond the ordinary intelligence
find themselves in difficulties. The circuit
of the palace is about seven stades, and the rich ornamentation
of the various parts proves how flourishing
was the condition of those who founded it. Though
the entire wood-work consists of cedar and cypress,
this is never allowed to appear; on the contrary, the
beams of the roof and the panelling, the pillars in the
chambers and halls, are covered with gold or silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
plates, and the roof consists wholly of silver tiles.
Most of these were carried off at the time of the
expedition of Alexander, and the remainder in the
reign of Antigonus and Seleucus-Nicanor. Nevertheless
the temple of Aine (<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of Anahita) at the time
when Antiochus Theos (261-245 <small>B.C.</small>) came to Ecbatana,
had gilded pillars round it; and some of the
gold plates in the side-walls were still remaining, and
the greater part of the silver plates, while the silver
tiles of the roof were still there in considerable quantities."<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
At the time of Alexander, Diodorus allows
the city of Ecbatana a circuit of 250 stades, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of
more than 30 miles.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Isidore of Charax mentions the
treasure-house at Ecbatana, the metropolis of Media
and the shrine of Anaitis, in which sacrifice was constantly
offered.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>It is not clear from these descriptions whether the
fortifications at that time included the whole city or
not. Herodotus only speaks of the fortifications of
the citadel, and represents the city as built at the foot
of its walls. Yet we may assume that Phraortes and
Cyaxares followed the pattern of the chief cities of
Assyria and Babylonia in placing a strong wall round
their city. A late and very uncertain authority, the
book of Judith, states that the walls of Ecbatana
consisted of splendid masonry, and reached a height
of seventy cubits (about 110 feet); the towers of these
walls were a hundred cubits in height, and there were
gates in them.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> When the Medes lost their empire and
became subject to the Ach&aelig;menids, it was to their
interest that the metropolis of the Medes should not be
fortified, but that the citadel should be in the hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
of a Persian garrison. Cyrus himself, therefore, after
the conquest of Astyages, or Darius, after suppressing
the rebellion of the Medes, may have thrown down
the walls which surrounded Ecbatana. The silence of
Herodotus respecting them would then be explained
by the fact that they were no longer in existence
in his time. The circuit of the external wall Herodotus
compares with the circuit of the city of Athens,
which, exclusive of the harbour cities but including
the space between the Phaleric and the long
walls, reached 60 stades, or 7-1/2 miles.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> If we chose
to assume that Herodotus included the Phaleric and
long walls in the circuit, the total extent would be
22-1/2 miles, an incredible length for the wall of a
citadel. Of the outer walls of the royal citadels at
Babylon, Diodorus puts those on the one bank of the
Euphrates at 30 stades, and those on the other at 60,
and of the two inner walls of the latter the first was
40 stades in length and the second 20.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> The circuit
of 22-1/2 miles may, therefore, refer only to the whole
extent of the citadel and city of Ecbatana, and it
would then come near the statement of Diodorus, who
puts the circuit of Ecbatana at 250 stades.</p>

<p>The royal citadel of the Ach&aelig;menids at Persepolis
was surrounded, according to Diodorus, with a triple
wall; the first wall was 16, the second 32, the third
60 cubits in height. These walls were decorated with
great expense, and adorned with towers. The citadel
of Ecbatana is said to have had seven walls, and,
however strange this may appear, religious no less
than military motives might have led to that number.
We know the importance ascribed in the Avesta to
the number seven&mdash;the seven supreme deities, and the
seven girdles of the earth. On the other hand, if we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
leave out of sight the hill on which the citadel was
built, the elevated plateau of Ecbatana did not present
the natural difficulties such as rivers and heights,
which strengthened the fortification of the Assyrian
metropolis and the walls of Babylon; hence it was
more important to meet this deficiency by the number
of towers and walls. The successive walls would have
been of little service had not each inner one been higher
than the outer, and they would have been the reverse
of serviceable, had not the distance between them been
so great that the arrows and missiles of the enemy,
when they had gained the outer walls, failed to reach
from it to the next, so that the assault of the next
wall had to be begun afresh after the capture of the
adjacent outer wall, without any cover. If we might
assume that the words of Polybius: "The palaces, of
which the extent reaches to about seven stades, lie
below the citadel," are to be interpreted as meaning
that these buildings lay under the protection of the
walls of the citadel, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> behind them&mdash;and it is
scarcely conceivable that the Ach&aelig;menids should have
chosen an unprotected palace in Media for a constant
residence, and deposited there large treasures, and the
archives of the kingdom&mdash;the circuit of the buildings
of the palace and that of the external wall of 60
stadia would give a space between the walls of each
of about 2000 feet; a distance not much in excess of
that absolutely required. Hence the circuit of 60
stadia from the outer wall does not appear too large.</p>

<p>More astonishing still is the account given by
Herodotus of the ornamentation of the turrets of these
walls&mdash;the colours of the turrets of the first five, the
silver and gold of the two last. The attempt has
been made to explain these statements as a legendary
echo of the fame of the splendour of Ecbatana in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
the time of Cyaxares and his successor Astyages.
But Polybius tells us very distinctly that the roof of
the palace and that of the temple of Anahita consisted
of silver tiles at the time of the Ach&aelig;menids, that
the beams and panels of the roofs as well as the
pillars were entirely covered with gold and silver
plates, and that these decorations remained in the
temple of Anahita at the time of Antiochus Theos.
This ornamentation might be extended to the turrets
of the inner walls. Considering the amount of the
spoil of Nineveh, it cannot be regarded as an impossibility
that the ramparts of the interior walls, the
length of which, according to the statement of Polybius,
did not reach more than 4200 feet, were covered
with plates of gold, and of the next with plates of
silver, when the roof of the palace could consist of
silver tiles. That the overthrow of the Assyrian kingdom
and the spoil of the cities brought considerable
possessions to the Median nation may be concluded
from the remark of Herodotus that the Persians had
adopted better clothing and more luxurious habits
from the Medes. The kings would without doubt
receive the richest part of the spoil. The decoration
of the turrets was possibly rude, but it exhibited in a
striking manner the splendour and exaltation of the
kingdom, which was thus encased in gold and silver,
while the sovereign dwelt in gold and silver chambers.
Such a parade of royal magnificence is not out of
harmony with the character of the ancient East. To
those who were not allowed to enter the wide and
high gates of the palace, these turrets showed far
and wide, through city and country, the splendour
of the citadel. The colours of the five outer walls
would be given by glazed tiles, such as those found in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
the ruins of Nineveh and Chalah, of Babylon and
Mugheir. We may assume with certainty that Cyaxares
desired to give to his palace and citadel a
splendour no less than that displayed by the palaces
of Nineveh, or the royal citadel of Nebuchadnezzar
in Babylon, or the golden citadel in Sardis. Religious
conceptions may also have determined the colours of
the decoration as well as the number of the walls.
As Auramazda sat in pure light, on a golden throne
on the golden Hukairya, so was the ruler on earth to
dwell in his palace of Ecbatana in golden chambers
surrounded by golden walls. The Avesta exhibits
Mithra with a golden helmet and silver coat of mail,
the wheels of his chariots are of gold, his horses are
greys,<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> shod on the fore hoofs with gold, and on
the hinder hoofs with silver; in like manner the
upper turrets of the citadel must shine with silver
and the highest with gold. We have seen that the
metals, owing to the brilliance inherent in them, belonged
in the ideas of the Iranians to the good spirits.
And as the splendour of gold and silver belonged to
the highest gods, so must the colours of the other
turrets have been assigned to the good spirits, to
whose protection each separate wall was entrusted.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>
<p>The account which Polybius gives of the structure
of the palace, the cedar and cypress wood of which
the door-posts, pillars, roofs, and panels in the walls
were made, shows that wood was employed in building
in Media, which agrees with the habits of mountaineers.
In Teheran and Ispahan buildings of wood
of this kind are still in use, and no doubt the
mountain forests of northern Media provided better
materials in ancient times than now. The noblest
trunks and best kinds of wood were sought out for
the royal house. The kings of Asshur, and Nebuchadnezzar
tell us in their inscriptions that they have
caused trees to be cut down on this or that mountain
for their buildings. The wooden palace, which Deioces,
and perhaps Phraortes, first erected, must have been
extended by Cyaxares, and may have been furnished
by him or his successor with the brilliant ornamentation.
The inner walls of the palace of the Ach&aelig;menids
at Persepolis, if we may draw this conclusion from
the metal supports which are found in the remains of
the stone walls, were decorated in a similar manner.
When the palace of the Median kings at Ecbatana
had become the summer residence and treasure-house
of the Persian monarchs, it would, no doubt, be
enriched and adorned yet more. The temple of
Anahita, connected with the palace, which Polybius
has described above, is the work of Artaxerxes II.
Alexander caused the spoil he had taken in Babylon,
Susa, Persepolis, and Pasargad&aelig;, to be brought to
Ecbatana, where he is said to have collected 180,000<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
talents in gold and silver.<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> At a later time, the
Arsacids are said to have resided at Ecbatana during
the summer like the Ach&aelig;menids.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> At the present
day, Hamadan, which is built high up on a slope of
Elvend, marks the site of the ancient Ecbatana. It
contains about 40,000 inhabitants; the ruins of the
ancient city have not yet been satisfactorily explored.
The slender pillars with lotus-like capitals, discovered
here, are like the pillars of Persepolis, and therefore
might be the work of the Ach&aelig;menids; what has
been discovered in engraved stones and coins comes
from the time of the Arsacids and Sassanids. Some
cylinders covered with cuneiform inscriptions have
not yet been examined.</p>

<p>Cyaxares had rescued Media from the most extreme
peril. The consequences of the defeat, in which his
father, with the greatest part of his army, fell before
the Assyrians, had been averted. Though subsequently
overpowered by the Scythians, he yet became
once more sovereign in his own country. This rise
of Media, and the weakening of the Assyrian kingdom
by the inundation of the Scythians, he used in order
to subjugate Armenia and Cappadocia. And though
he was not able to achieve anything decisive against
the Lydians, he attained a greater success; in combination
with Babylonia he avenged on the Assyrians
the supremacy they had exercised over Media; he
overthrew the remnant of that kingdom, whose tough
vigour showed itself even at the final hour in an
obstinate resistance. It was a great achievement and
at the same time an important extension of the
Median dominions, not merely by the whole extent
of the Assyrian country on the left bank of the Tigris,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
which fell to Media, but also by the closer connection
which Cyaxares thus obtained with Armenia
and Cappadocia, the subject lands to the west. Then
followed the spread of the Median power over the
kindred nations in the north and east of Iran. The
Persians were already subjected to Phraortes, and
Cyaxares brought under his sovereignty the Sagartians,
Hyrcanians, Parthians, and Bactrians; he made the
Sac&aelig; dependant on him, and in the east perhaps
extended his power as far as the Indus. From his
proud citadel at Ecbatana he ruled from the Halys
to the Oxus. It was a powerful empire. Herodotus
depicts the reign of Cyaxares when he says:
"He was far more powerful than his predecessors."
With the Medes he passes as the founder of their
sovereignty; and his reign must have been held
in grateful remembrance, not by the Medes only, but
also by the subject nations. Those who afterwards
attempted to bring the Medes and Sagartians under
arms against the dominion of the Persians, called
themselves the descendants of Cyaxares&mdash;and one
even laid aside his own name, Phraortes, to do so.</p>

<p>After the fall of Assyria the leading portion passed
to Media, Babylonia, and Lydia. As the two first had
united for the overthrow of Assyria, and had come to
terms with Lydia for this object, so in other respects
they displayed a friendly feeling towards each other.
The daughter of Cyaxares became the consort of
Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and the daughter of
Alyattes, king of Lydia, was married to his son
Astyages. Afterwards, Babylon prevented the attempt
of Egypt to unite Syria with the land of the
Nile; it was eagerly occupied with subjugating Mesopotamia
and Syria, while Lydia established its power
over the tribes and cities of Asia Minor as far as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Halys. Neither Media nor Lydia thought of putting
any hindrances in the way of the extension of
the Babylonian dominion over Syria and Ph&#339;nicia.
Of these three kingdoms, thus connected by mutual
alliances, Media was the strongest. Babylonia and
Lydia were not equal either in extent of country or
amount of population; Lydia was perhaps inferior
in the vigour of the ruling tribe, and Babylonia certainly
inferior in the military strength of the population.
Even when united they did not reach the
size or strength of the Median power, whose army
Cyaxares had arranged, and for which he had provided
at Ecbatana a strongly fortified centre, equidistant
from the Halys and the Oxus. When Astyages
ascended the throne, on the death of his father in
593 <small>B.C.</small>, he entered upon the inheritance of a secure
dominion in peaceful and friendly relations to all the
neighbouring powers. While his father-in-law, Alyattes
of Lydia, and his son Croesus were occupied in subjugating
the Carians and the Greek cities on the west
coast of Anatolia (III. 439), and Nebuchadnezzar
carried on one campaign after another in order to
incorporate in his kingdom the great trading marts
of the Syrian coasts, Astyages could enjoy, for more
than thirty years, the fruits of the efforts by which
his father had founded and established the Median
empire.</p>

Museum," 1875, s. 264 ff.) on the date of the eclipse, I believe
that Oltmann and Bailly's calculation may hold good for it, until it is
proved astronomically that in the year 610 <small>B.C.</small> an eclipse of the sun
would not have been visible in Asia Minor. If this were proved,
Herodotus' dates for Cyaxares, who not only in his work but on the
evidence of the inscription of Behistun, was the founder of the Median
empire, would have to be thrown back more than half a century,
which the date of Cyrus does not allow. To assume a confusion of
Cyaxares with Astyages in Herodotus, is impossible, for Cyaxares is
twice expressly mentioned (1, 74, and 103), and moreover Astyages is
spoken of as the son of Cyaxares to whom Aryanis was married. Nor
can I regard it as finally proved that the double capture of Sardis
rests simply on Callisthenes, and a deduction from Strabo. Gelzer
agrees that the incursions of the Cimmerians into Asia Minor and their
establishment in Cappadocia must be placed at the least before the
year 705 <small>B.C.</small> ("Z. Aegypt. Sprache," 1875, s. 18); the devastation of
Phrygia by the Cimmerians he puts in the year 696 or 676 <small>B.C.</small>
According to the dates of Eusebius Midas (the husband of Damodike)
began to reign in Olymp. 10, 3 = 738, and took his own life in Ol. 21, 2
= 695 (Euseb. ed. Sch&ouml;ne, 2, 82, 85); his reign extended therefore from
738 to 695 <small>B.C.</small> Hence the devastation of Phrygia by the Cimmerians
must have taken place in the year 695. If they were masters of
Phrygia at this date, it is not easy to see why these successes did not
carry them on into Lydia. As a fact, this is far from improbable; and
if the image at Nymsi is their work, they would not have had any
time for it in 630 <small>B.C.</small>, for that incursion was merely a "plundering
raid," and the change in the dynasty of Lydia, the accession of Gyges
in the year 689 <small>B.C.</small> (Vol. III. 416), seems to me to point to some
previous violent change. Besides, Strabo's words, p. 61, and p. 647,
are plain and conclusive enough, so that I see no reason to attach
much weight to the interpretation of the passage, p. 627. Cf. C&aelig;sar,
"Ind. lect. Marb. Sem. aestivum," 1876.</p></div>

with the Babylonian star-worship. The only fact in favour of this is
the black of the second wall; but as the highest turrets exhibited the
two most precious metals, the others may have received the colours of
the remaining five, over all of which Kshathra vairya presided, and in
the order of the Avesta in which silver and copper follow gold, while
iron and steel end the list. It can hardly be proved that Babylonian
star-worship had a decisive influence among the Medes at the time of
Cyaxares. Isaiah xiii. 17 might be quoted against the wealth of
Ecbatana, but this passage only gives the idea of the writer that the
Medes would not be bought off by Babylonian money, and abandons the
destruction of Babylon for the sake of gold. Setting this aside, the
episodes quoted above show that at the time of Astyages men could
regret the loss of ancient simplicity in Media, and extol it against the
gold which had come from Nineveh to Ecbatana, and against the gold
of Babylon (p. 301). The nation may also have remained in simple
habits of life however brilliant the royal citadel may have been. Yet
it has already been observed in the text that at the time of Cyaxares
and Astyages the upper classes lived in wealth and comfort.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE TRIBES OF THE PERSIANS.</h3>


<p>The oldest subjects in the Median kingdom were the
Persians. Their country lay in the south-west corner
of the table-land of Iran. The heights of the Zagrus,
which run down to the sea in a south-easterly direction,
divide it from the ancient kingdom of Elam,
and the land of the Tigris, just as in the north they
divide the land of the Medes from the valley of the
two rivers. The Eastern border of the Persian
territory was formed, almost down to the coast, by
the great desert, which fills the centre of Iran; the
northern boundary towards the land of the Medes
is marked by the range which the Greeks call Parachoatras;
the name would be <i>Kuruhvathra</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> very
brilliant, in Old Persian. The southern boundary of
Persia was the sea. Nearchus, who sailed along the
coast of Persia, gives it an extent of 4400 stades, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
550 miles; their land began at the mouth of the
Oroatis (Old Persian, <i>Aurvaiti</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the swift),<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> the
Tsab, which falls into the Persian Gulf below the
modern Hindian, and reached to the east almost as
far as the entrance into this gulf, where it ended
opposite the island of Colo&euml; (Kishm).<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Euripides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
contrasts the sun-lit mountain flats of Persia with the
wintry land of Media and the citadels of Bactria.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>
According to Strabo the coast of Persia was hot and
sandy, and, with the exception of some palms, produced
no fruit. But beyond the coast was a land of
very great fertility, abounding in lakes and rivers, and
providing the most excellent pasture. Further to the
north, the Persian land became cold and mountainous,
and supported nothing but droves of camels and their
keepers. Arrian tells us that to the north of the
coast of Persia the air was temperate, and the land
traversed by the clearest streams, in addition to which
there were also lakes; the meadows were grassy and
well watered, and provided excellent pastures for
horses and other beasts of draught. The soil produced
all kinds of fruits and even wine, but not olives. The
forests were extensive and rich in game, and all kinds
of water-fowl were to be found there. But further
to the north the land of the Persians was wintry and
full of snow.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> What the Greeks relate of the desolation
of the Persian coast is still applicable; it consists
of naked sand-flats, broken only by scanty groves of
palms. Above this coast the soil rises in terraces,
which are separated from each other by yet higher
ranges. Further to the north the slopes of the mountains
provide excellent pastures, till the ground becomes
more bare as we approach Media, while on the
east it gradually passes into the great desert of the
centre. On the mountain terraces and in the depressions
between them are some favoured lands and valleys.
The warmth of the southern situation is tempered by
the elevation of the soil and the winds blowing from
the sea. This happy climate allows a perpetual
spring to reign, and increases the fertility which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
abundant mountain springs produce in such a degree
that groves of orchard trees, cypresses, and myrtles
alternate with vineyards and carpets of flowers. The
beauty of Persia and the fertility of the vegetation is
concentrated in the valleys of Kazerun, Shiras, and
Merdasht, which lie in stages one above the other,
between mountain walls which rise to a height of
8000 feet. The most extensive and at the same time
the highest valley is that of Merdasht. It is traversed
by the Murghab, which brings an abundant supply
of water from the snow-covered heights in the north-west.
The upper course is surrounded by steep cones,
and jagged walls of rock; in the lower part it takes
another name, and is called the Pulwar. Further
down, it unites with the Kum-i-Firuz (the Araxes
of the Greeks), and from this confluence down to the
mouth in the great lake of Bakhtegan it is known
as the Bendemir. The Greeks called the Pulwar the
Medus, and the Bendemir, which is also known as
the Kur in modern times, they named the Cyrus.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p>According to Herodotus the Persians regarded their
land as of moderate extent, poorly equipped, and
filled with rocks. In the Books of the Laws which
are ascribed to Plato, we are told that the Persian
land is naturally adapted to produce strong shepherds,
and as they had to watch their flocks night and day,
they were thus in a position to do good service in war.
As a fact Persia is a mountainous country; the slopes
are admirably fitted for cattle breeding, but there is
little room or encouragement for agriculture. According
to Xenophon's description, the Persians in ancient
times were much occupied in the chase, and in riding;
they only ate once in the day, and at their banquets
goblets might indeed be seen, but no pitchers of wine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
Strabo remarks, with reference to a later period, that
the Persian youth remained long in the open air
with their flocks, and were eager hunters; when
thus engaged, their only drink was water, their food
bread, flesh, and salt. The Greeks with one consent
describe the Persians of ancient times as simple,
hardy, self-controlled men, of great endurance and
martial vigour, with few requirements. They were
also called "Eaters of Terebinths," in order to mark
the scantiness of their food: their drink was water;
and their clothing, coats as well as trousers, were of
leather.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>The nation of the Persians consisted of various
tribes. Herodotus gives a special prominence to
three, on which the rest were dependent. These were
the Pasargadae, the Maraphians, and the Maspians.
"Other tribes are the Panthialaei, the Derrusiaei, the
Germanii, all of which are agricultural; while the remainder,
the Dai, Mardi, Dropici, and Sagartii are
Nomads."<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> According to this statement six of the
Persian tribes carried on agriculture, and four were
pastoral. But the Germanians and Sagartians were
distinguished from the tribes of the Persians in the
narrower sense. The Sagartians (A&ccedil;agarta) are spoken
of in the inscriptions of Darius, and by Herodotus himself
in other passages, as a separate nation; we have
already found their country on the western edge of the
great desert, and observed its character (p. 6). The
Germanians of Herodotus are the Carmanians of the
later Greeks, who also passed with them as a separate
nation, though closely allied to the Persians and Medes.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
They wandered to and fro to the east of Persia in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
the district now called Kirman. The number of the
tribes mentioned by Herodotus would therefore have to
be reduced to the Pasargadae, Maraphians, Maspians,
Panthialaeans, Derusiaeans, Dai, Mardi, and Dropici,
if we did not hear of two others in the inscriptions
of Darius, the Yutiyas and the Patisuvaris, whose
names were known to the later Greeks in the form
Utei and Pateischorei. These later authorities tell us
also of other Persian tribes: Kyrtians, Rhapaesans,
Stobaeans, Suzaeans, etc. They also reckon the
Paraetaci, or Paraetaceni, among the Persians.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> The
Mardians of Herodotus are also called Amardians by
later writers, who place them in the West, among the
mountains which divide Persia from Elam.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> With
regard to the position of the rest of the tribes, we can
only ascertain that the Pasargadae occupied the best
part of the Persian land&mdash;the valley of the Pulwar;
that the Maraphians<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> and the Maspians were their
neighbours, and the land of the Pateischorei followed
next after that of the Pasargadae on the eastern
side, towards Carmania. Besides these three chief
tribes, the Pasargadae, Maraphians, and Maspians,
the Persian nation, according to these statements,
was made up of a considerable number of more or
less powerful tribes, of whom each one, like the
chief tribes themselves, must have had a separate
territory, or, at any rate, a pasture for its flocks.</p>

<p>If the name Parsua could signify Persians, the inscriptions
of the kings of Asshur would confirm the
division of the Persians into several tribes. Shalmanesar
II. tells us, that in the year 833 <small>B.C.</small> he
received tribute from the heads of the Parsuas, as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
inscription says: from twenty-seven princes of the
Parsuas. Afterwards Tiglath Pilesar II. traversed the
land of the Parsuas and imposed tribute upon them
(744 <small>B.C.</small>).<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> The books of the Hebrews confirm
Esarhaddon's dominion over Persia, inasmuch as they
tell us that he settled Persians and Dai (Dahas) in
Samaria (III. 154).</p>

<p>It must have been in the period of the supremacy
of Assyria, at the latest in the first half of the seventh
century <small>B.C.</small>, that the worship of the gods, which the
Persians shared from all antiquity with their fellow-tribesmen
on the table-land of Iran, the worship of
Mithra, Vayu, Anahita, and fire, underwent the change
which bears the name of Zarathrustra. As we saw
good reason to assume, the new doctrine first came to
the Medes from the North-East; from the Medes it
passed, without doubt, to the Persians. If Herodotus
places the Magians, or special priestly order, among
the tribes of the Medes and not among those of the
Persians, among whom Strabo is the first to mention
them, the conclusion is, as has been sufficiently
proved, not that the Persians were without priests
before and after the reform, but rather that even after
the reform the priestly families remained in their
natural unions, and did not form themselves into a
special tribe (p. 192).</p>

<p>The supremacy of Assyria over the West of Iran
came to an end when Phraortes united the tribes of
the Medes under his leadership, and, towards the year
640 <small>B.C.</small>, undertook to maintain the independence of
Media against Assurbanipal, the successor of Esarhaddon.
In this struggle the Persians joined the
Medes and ranged themselves under them. Herodotus,
who obviously follows the tradition of the Medes, re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>presents
Phraortes as marching against the Persians,
conquering and subjugating them; according to the
Persian account, which is preserved in Ctesias, the
chief of the Medes induced the Persians to revolt
against the Assyrians, and to join him, by the promise
that they should remain free under his leadership (III.
250). The situation of affairs agrees better with the
second version than with the first. Considering the
enormous power which Assyria under Assurbanipal
possessed down to the middle of the seventh century,
it is hardly probable that Phraortes would have inaugurated
the recent independence of Media by an
attack on the Persians, which might, and indeed must,
drive them into the arms of the Assyrians. It is far
more probable that the two nations formed a league
against Assyria. As already observed, the annihilation
of the kingdom of Elam, which Assurbanipal accomplished
in the year 645 <small>B.C.</small>, would supply the Persians
with a strong incentive to unite themselves with the
kindred and more powerful nation of the Medes.</p>

<p>Of the three tribes of the Pasargadae, Maraphians,
and Maspians, the most prominent&mdash;so Herodotus tells
us&mdash;are the Pasargadae.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> To them belongs the race
of the Ach&aelig;menids, from which sprang the Persian
kings. In the inscription of Behistun, King Darius
says: "From old time we were kings; eight of my
family have been kings (Kshayathiya), I am the
ninth; from very ancient times we have been kings."<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
He enumerates his ancestors: "My father was Vista&ccedil;pa,
the father of Vista&ccedil;pa was Arsama, the father
of Arsama was Ariyaramna, the father of Ariyaramna
was Khaispis, the father of Khaispis was Hakhamanis;
hence we are called Hakhamanisiya (Ach&aelig;menids)."
In these words Darius gives the tree of his own family
up to Khaispis; this was the younger branch of the
Ach&aelig;menids. Teispes, the son of Ach&aelig;menes, had
two sons; the elder was Cambyses (Kambujiya), the
younger Ariamnes; the son of Cambyses was Cyrus
(Kurus), the son of Cyrus was Cambyses II.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> Hence
Darius could indeed maintain, that eight princes of
his family had preceded him; but it was not correct
to maintain that they had been kings before him,
and that he was the ninth king.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>In this series of the ancestors of Darius we find
names belonging not only to the East of Iran, but
also to the Arians of India. The name Cambyses
(Kambujiya) points to the Cambojas, a nation which
we found in the north-west of India (IV. 249); the
name Cyrus (Kurus) to the ancestors of the ancient
princely race who founded the first great empire in the
land of the Ganges on the upper course of the river,
whose contest with and overthrow by the Pandus is
celebrated by the Indian epic, while the name Vista&ccedil;pa
repeats the name of the King of Bactria, whom the
prayers of the Avesta extol as the protector of Zarathrustra
(p. 132). Of Ach&aelig;menes we are told that
an eagle nourished him;<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> a prophet of the Hebrews
calls Cyrus "the eagle;" we know the importance
which the Avesta ascribes to the two eagles of the
sky, and the modern Persian epic to Simurgh; and we
have seen that the standard of the Ach&aelig;menids was
an eagle (p. 173). Hence from this notice we may
with certainty conclude that the tradition of the
Persians ascribed to this ancestor of their kings a
youth distinguished by the favour of heaven.</p>

<p>As Cambyses the father of Cyrus is a contemporary
of Astyages of Media, Teispes the father of Cambyses
must be reckoned a contemporary of Cyaxares, and
Ach&aelig;menes, the father of Teispes, as a contemporary
of Phraortes.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> We must therefore assume either
that Ach&aelig;menes was at the head of the Persians, at
the time when they joined Media, or that he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
established by Phraortes as the chief of Persia and
his vassal-king, and that his throne passed with the
duties of vassalage to his descendants Teispes and
Cambyses. It is not very probable that the traditions
of the Persians should have accorded signs of divine
favour to the youth of a man, who had been placed
over them after their subjugation as viceroy of Media.
Moreover, we find among the Persians, according to
this tradition, a form of constitution, such as a Median
viceroy would hardly have established, even for
the object of overthrowing the Median power. The
race of the Ach&aelig;menids belonged to the tribe of
the Pasargadae; we may therefore assume that
Ach&aelig;menes was the first to become chief of this tribe.</p>

<p>Aeschylus enumerates the seven men who stand at
the side of the king of the Persians.<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> Josephus says
that the "seven houses" of the Persians had named
Darius as king. As a fact we see that when Darius,
after the extinction of the older line of the descendants
of Ach&aelig;menes, sets himself to ascend the throne,
six men stand at his side, whom Herodotus distinguishes
as the "first of the Persians." The Laws
ascribed to Plato say that the empire was then
divided into seven parts between Darius and the Six,
and that a relic of this division was still in existence.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
In regard to the privileges of the Six and their
descendants we find that they consisted in the right
of free access to the king, and that the king could
choose his chief wife only from their families;<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> the
descendants of the Six had also the right to wear the
head-dress of the king, the upright <i>kidaris</i>, which was
the symbol of royal dignity. In the kingdom of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Sassanids, we find seven hereditary princes under the
king; these princes, like the king, wear crowns, but
their crowns are lower than that of the king; the "sons
of the houses," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the members of these seven families,
form the highest rank of the nobility. Hence in these
six chieftains of the Persians standing at the side of and
beneath the seventh, who is the prince of the Pasargadae,
we may suppose that we have the princes of the
remaining tribes.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> And in respect of the privileges
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>of the six co-chieftains in the kingdom of the Ach&aelig;menids
we may assume that they originally occupied
a position close to the king, and formed the council
and court of the chief tribal prince. These privileges
the Greeks ascribe to the services which the Six
rendered at the time when Darius ascended the
throne. But as the seven houses existed before, and
the Six had previously been "the first of the Persians,"
their privileged position must have been of an older
date; it must have been introduced by Cyrus or be
of even more remote origin. It is not probable that
such a mighty warrior prince as Cyrus would, after
the reduction of the Medes, impose limitations on his
power by sharing the symbols of royalty and hereditary
privileges. According to the narrative of Herodotus,
Cyrus does not simply command the Persians
to take up arms against the Medes, but he assembles
the tribes, and ascertains their feeling. In considering
the peculiar position of these six families we may
certainly assume, that under the ancestors of Cyrus
there were chiefs among the Persians with whom
the Ach&aelig;menids had to deal. If the Ach&aelig;menids
were the heads of the tribe of the Pasargadae, the
other tribes would have chiefs also. Yet we only
hear of "six princes" besides the Ach&aelig;menids,
though we have seen that the number of the Persian
tribes was considerably more than seven.</p>

<p>Following the indications thus given, we may
sketch the course of events as follows. When
Ach&aelig;menes had acquired the headship of the tribe
of the Pasargadae, he must have combined the two
neighbouring tribes, the Maraphians and Maspians,
whom Herodotus classes with the Pasargadae as the
most important among the Persians, into closer
union, perhaps by some understanding with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
chiefs. Supported by these three tribes, who possessed
the favoured regions of Kazerun, Shiras, and Merdasht,
Ach&aelig;menes must then have subjugated the
remainder to his power. Herodotus told us above
that the remaining tribes depended on the three
mentioned. They must, therefore, have been combined
into larger groups, and in fact into four
communities. To the chiefs who became the heads
of these new combinations, a position must have been
accorded similar to that enjoyed by the Maraphians
and Maspians beside Ach&aelig;menes&mdash;above all, the right
to bequeath the chieftainship to their descendants.
When the chiefs of the Persians, now seven in number,
mutually guaranteed to each other their position,
the foundation was laid of a community of interests,
and thus of a community of the Persian nation.
That the princes of the four new combinations of
tribes belonged to those tribes, and not to the three
first, is proved by the inscription of Darius at Naksh-i-Rustem,
where one of the princes of the date of
Darius is called a Pateischorean. In some such way
as this Ach&aelig;menes may have brought about the
union of the Persian tribes, and at the same time
have obtained the leadership of them. His position
thus rested essentially on the relation of the prince
of the Pasargadae to the other six tribal princes, a
relation of which we find no trace in the Medes.
That the number seven was normal for the combinations
of the tribes we may ascribe to the influence
of the recently-introduced doctrine of Zarathrustra,
of which we found echoes in the legend of Ach&aelig;menes.</p>

<p>Ach&aelig;menes and his race after him must have had
their dwelling in the canton of the tribe to which
they belonged, at the place of assembly of the Pasargadae,
the chief town, which bore the name of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
tribe. Supported by this tribe, Ach&aelig;menes succeeded
in uniting the people; on it and the neighbouring
Marapheans and Maspians depended the importance
of the Ach&aelig;menids. Strabo calls Pasargadae the
ancient seat, and with Persepolis the patriarchal
abode of the Persian kings,<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> and here, on ascending
the throne, they were consecrated. Here Cyrus deposited
his treasures; here he found his last resting-place.
We must look for this place in "Hollow
Persia," as the Greeks call it, in the plain of Merdasht,
to the east of the later Istakhr, the city of the Sassanids,
below the confluence of the Medus and Cyrus
(<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the Pulwar and Kum-i-Firuz) in the land of
the Bendemir.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>When Ach&aelig;menes had united the tribes of the
Persians by means of the new hereditary chieftainships,
and got into his hands the supreme power with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
the co-operation of the six princes in council and
jurisdiction, he joined the king of the Medes, who
had also united the tribes of his people, soon after the
year 645 <small>B.C.</small>, as we were compelled to assume, for
common defence against Assyria. Being weaker than
the Median king, he ranged himself under his leadership
and power, agreed to follow him in war, and
accepted the position of his general and vassal. The
relation must have been similar to that which Firdusi
represents as existing between his kings and the
princes of Sejestan (p. 252). In this combination the
Persians shared the dangers of the war against king
Assurbanipal, and the defeat of Phraortes, no less
than the defeat of Cyaxares by the Scythians; on the
other hand, they were the comrades of Cyaxares in his
struggles against the Lydians, and in his victory over
Assyria, while they took an active part in the annihilation
of Nineveh. At the same time we may assume
that this dependent position became more strongly
marked as the power of Media increased, and we may
believe Herodotus that their soldiers joined in subjugating
the other tribes of the table-land of Iran, and
marched with the armies of the Medes to the wars
which Cyaxares carried on in the East. The episode
of Parsondes exhibits a Persian at the court, in the
council, and in the army of the Median king; and
the position of the Persians under the successors of
Ach&aelig;menes, Teispes, and Cambyses, must have closely
resembled the position of the other nations subject
to the Median power. Cyaxares and his successor
Astyages would have regarded Teispes and Cambyses
merely as their viceroys over Persia, though they did
not disturb the succession in the tribe of Ach&aelig;menes.
If Darius still calls all his ancestors kings, and extends
this title to his father, grandfather, and great-grand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>father,
who were not viceroys, that is merely the
custom and view of the East; even under the great
king, the King of kings, a vassal is still a king. The
hereditary viceroys of Persia under the Arsacids, one
and all, put the title "king" on their coins. When
Papek, and Ardeshir after him, had taken their place,
they call themselves kings; Ardeshir, the founder of
the dominion of the Sassanids, designates himself as
"king," "king of the divine stock," even before he
has overthrown his own king, Artabanus, the Arsacid.
As the youth of Ach&aelig;menes is ennobled in the
older tradition, so later legends surrounded the life of
the progenitor of the Sassanids with premonitory
indications.</p>

bithan</i> is Aramaic. The book of Esther mentions the seven princes of
the Persians and Medes, "who may behold the countenance of the
king and have the first place in the kingdom," i. 14. The names of the
six who aided Darius in slaying Gaumata, as given in Herodotus, agree
with the inscription of Behistun, with the exception of one name.
Herodotus gives Aspathines for the Ardumanis of Darius. The list of
Ctesias is wholly different. If we examine them more closely we find
that Ctesias has given the names of the sons of the comrades of Darius
for the comrades themselves. Instead of Gobryas he puts Mardonius
the son of Gobryas, instead of Otanes Anaphes (so we must read the
name Onophes); Anaphes, according to Herod. 7, 62, is the son of
Otanes. The name Hydarnes agrees with the inscription and with
Herodotus, but the son of Hydarnes had the same name as his father
(Herod. 7, 83, 211). The Barisses of Ctesias must be the eldest son of
Intaphernes whom Darius allowed to live; he was called after his
grandfather, Vaya&ccedil;para, as was often the case with the Persians. The
Ariarathes, who afterwards governed Cappadocia, claimed to have
sprung from Anaphes, whom Darius made satrap or king of Cappadocia.
Anaphes was succeeded by a son of the same name; after him
came Datames, Ariamnes, Ariarathes I., who governed Cappadocia at
the time of Artaxerxes Ochus; his son Ariathes II. crucified Perdiccas
in the year 322 <small>B.C.</small> when he had conquered him, though an old man
of 82 years; Droysen, "Hellenismus," 2<sup>2</sup>, 95. The Norondobates in
Ctesias I cannot explain, unless we ought to read Rhodobates. Mithridates,
who in Xenophon's time had been governor of Lycaonia from
about 420 <small>B.C.</small>, is called a son of Rhodobates (Diog. Laert. 3, 25), and
his father and grandfather are said to have been viceroys of Pontus.
The ancestor would be one of the seven, to whom the kingdom of
Pontus was given for his services; Polyb. 5, 43. Mithridates Eupator
calls himself the sixteenth after Darius; Appian, "Bell. Mith." c.
112; cf. Justin, 38, 7. These quotations will be sufficient to show
that the rank of the six tribal princes of the Persians, like that of the
chief princes, was originally hereditary, as the governorships left to
their descendants outside Persia must have remained in their families.</p></div>

(&#928;&#945;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#961;&#947;&#940;&#948;&#945;&#953;)
following Anaximenes of Lampsacus, represents Pasargadae as
first built by Cyrus; so Curt. 5, 11: Cyrus Pasargadum urbem condiderat.
It cannot be doubted that Cyrus built there, and Alexander,
according to Arrian (3, 18), found there the treasures of Cyrus. Strabo
also tells us that Cyrus built the city and citadel, p. 730. From the
accounts of the march of Alexander from Persepolis to Pasargadae,
and from his return from the Indus to Pasargadae and Persepolis, it
is clear that Pasargadae lay to the east or south-east of Persepolis. If
Pasargadae is placed at Murghab, the only reason is the statement
that the grave of Cyrus was at Pasargadae, and this grave has been
identified with the pyramid of Murghab, in the immediate proximity
of which a relief exhibits the picture of Cyrus. But the portrait of
Cyrus there is very different from the portrait of Darius and his
successors on the tombs at Rachmed, and Naksh-i-Rustem; and the
building at Murghab may have served another purpose. According to
Pliny ("H. N." 6, 26, 29) we ought to look for Pasargadae to the
south of Lake Bakhtegan, near Fasa, or Darabgerd; flumen Sitioganus,
quo Pasargadas septimo die navigatur. Sitioganus is the
modern Sitaragan. Ptolemy puts Pasargadae in the neighbourhood of
Caramania, and Oppert therefore identifies it with the ruins of Tell-i-Zohak
near Fasa, and looks for the mountain Paraga of the inscriptions
in the modern Forg: "Journal Asiat." 1872, p. 549.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE FALL OF THE MEDIAN KINGDOM.</h3>


<p>"Cyaxares was succeeded by his son Astyages on
the throne of the Medes"&mdash;such is the narrative of
Herodotus&mdash;"and the latter had a daughter named
Mandane. Once he saw his daughter in a dream, and
water came from her in such quantities that all Asia
was inundated. This vision Astyages laid before the
interpreters of dreams, among the Magians, and their
interpretation alarmed him. To guard against the
event portended, he gave his daughter, who was
already of marriageable age, to none of the Medes
of suitable rank, but to a Persian of the name of
Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, who was of a good
family, but quiet in disposition; he regarded him as
of less account than a Mede of the middle class.
Mandane had not been married a year when Astyages
had a second vision; from his daughter's womb there
grew up a vine-tree which overshadowed all Asia.
This dream also he laid before the interpreters, and
caused his daughter, who was with child, to be brought
from the land of the Persians and be kept under
watch; his intention was to kill the child, which, as
the Magians said, was destined to reign in his place.
When Mandane bore a son, Astyages sent for Harpagus,
a man akin to the royal household,<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> the most faithful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
of his servants, in whose care he trusted on all occasions,
and bade him take Mandane's child to his house
and there kill it, and bury it, in whatever way he
chose. When the boy was given to him, dressed as if
for a funeral, Harpagus went in tears to his house,
told his wife the orders of Astyages, and declared that
he would not be the perpetrator of this murder even
though Astyages should lose his reason more utterly
than at present, and fall into worse madness: 'the
child is akin to me; Astyages is old and without male
heirs, if the throne passes to the daughter, whose
child he is now putting to death by my hands,
I shall find myself in the greatest danger. Inasmuch
as my present safety demands it the child must
die. But the murder must be done by one of the
people of Astyages, not by any one of mine.' Without
delay he sent a messenger to one of the cowherds
of the king, Mithradates by name, whose pastures
lay on mountains to the north of Ecbatana, where
wild beasts are numerous. When the herdman came
he found the whole house of Harpagus filled with
lamentation, and saw a struggling and screaming
child adorned with gold and variegated robes, and
Harpagus said to him: 'Astyages commands you
to expose this child on the most desolate mountains,
in order that it may die as quickly as possible.'
The herdman believed that the child belonged
to one of the household of Harpagus, and took it, but
from the servant who accompanied him out of the
city he ascertained that it was the child of Mandane
and Cambyses. Returning to his hut, he found that
his wife Spako (the Medes call a dog Spako) had just
brought forth a dead child, and when she saw the well-grown
and beautiful child which her husband showed
her, she clasped his knees in tears, and entreated him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
not to expose it, but to take away her dead child in
its place, and bring it up as her own son:<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> Thus doing
you will not be guilty of wrong towards your master;
the dead child will receive a splendid funeral, and the
other will not lose his life. The herdman took his
wife's advice, and did as she bade him. He placed his
own dead child in the basket, put on him all the
ornaments of the other, and placed him on the wildest
mountain. Three days after he told Harpagus that
he was ready to show him the corpse of the child.
Harpagus sent the most trustworthy of his bodyguard,
and buried the herdman's child. But the herdman's
wife brought up the other child, and gave him some
other name than Cyrus, by which he was afterwards
called. When he was ten years old an incident
happened which caused him to be known. He was
playing with his comrades, in the village in which the
herdman lived, in the street, and his playfellows had
chosen him whom they considered the herdman's son
to be king. He assigned to every one his work, and
bade one build houses, and another to be a lance-bearer;
one he made 'the king's eye,' and another
'the bearer of his messages.' Among the boys who
were playing with him was the son of Artembares, a
man of high rank in Media. This boy failed to do
what Cyrus ordered; and Cyrus bade the others take
him, and whipped him severely. The boy hastened to
the city and complained to his father of the treatment
he had received from the son of the cowherd. His
father took him to the king and showed his son's
shoulders, and said: 'This insult we have received
from thy servant, the son of the cowherd.' Astyages
summoned Mithradates and his son. When Astyages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
asked the latter how he dared so to insult the son of
a man in such high favour with the king as Artembares,
the lad maintained that he was right in acting
as he did, but if he was to blame he was ready to
bear the penalty.  Astyages was surprised by the
likeness of the boy to his own family, and the freedom
of his reply. After applying the torture to Mithradates,
he soon discovered the truth. He was more
enraged at Harpagus than at Mithradates, but concealed
his resentment. When Harpagus at his request
had acknowledged what he had done, Astyages said:
'The boy was alive, and all that had been done was
well. Let Harpagus send his own son to join the
new-comer, and also come himself to the banquet.' As
soon as the son of Harpagus, a boy of thirteen years,
was in the palace, Astyages caused him to be slain,
and the dismembered limbs were boiled and roasted,
while the head, hands, and feet, were put in a covered
basket. At the banquet Harpagus was served with
the flesh of his own son, while the other guests ate
the flesh of sheep.  When Harpagus had eaten,
Astyages inquired whether he had enjoyed the meal,
and when he replied that he had enjoyed it greatly,
the servants of the king brought him the basket, bade
him uncover it and take what he would. Harpagus
controlled himself, and said that whatever the king
did was best. Then Astyages took counsel with the
Magians who had interpreted the dreams: they were
to consider everything, and give him the advice best
for himself and his house. The Magians declared that
they had it much at heart that the dominion of Astyages
should continue; for if the throne passed to the
boy who was a Persian, the Medes would be governed
by others, 'but if thou remainest king we are rulers in
our degree, and have great honour from thee.' But as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the boy had already been king in the game, the dream
was fulfilled; the king might send him back to Persia
to his parents. Astyages did so. When Cyrus came
to the house of Cambyses, his parents received him
with great joy, when they found who he was, since
they believed that he was already dead, and desired
to know how he had been preserved. He told them
that he had been supposed to be the son of the
cowherd, but on the way he had ascertained everything
from the convoy which Astyages had sent with
him. He related how the wife of the herdman had
brought him up, and praised her much, and Spako
(the dog) was always on his lips. His parents seized
on the name in order that the preservation of the
boy might appear to be the work of the gods, and
laid the foundation for the legend that a dog had
suckled Cyrus when exposed."</p>

<p>"When Cyrus came to manhood and was the
bravest and best-beloved of his comrades, Harpagus
sought to win him by presents with a view to vengeance
on Astyages, for he regarded the injury done to
Cyrus as no less than that done to himself. He
had already prepared his revenge. As Astyages was
severe towards the Medes, he had secretly persuaded
the chief men among them, one by one, that an end
must be put to the rule of Astyages, and that Cyrus
must be raised to the throne. When this was done
and all was ready, he wished to discover his views to
Cyrus, who was then in Persia. As the roads were
guarded, he invented the following stratagem: he
prepared a hare by cutting open the belly without
further injury to the skin, inserted a letter, and then
again closed the opening. This hare he gave with
some nets to the most faithful of his slaves, and sent
him, as though he were a hunter, to Persia, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
command to take the hare to Cyrus, and at the same
time to tell him that he must open it himself and
let no one be present at the time. Cyrus opened the
hare, and found written: 'Son of Cambyses, the gods
regard thee with favour, or thou hadst not attained to
such good fortune. Avenge thy death on Astyages,
for dead thou art in his intention; it is through the
gods and me that thou livest. Long ago thou hast
learnt all that befell thee, and what I have suffered at
the hands of the king because I did not slay thee, but
gave thee to the cowherd. If thou wilt follow my
counsel, thou shalt rule over all the land over which
Astyages was ruler. Persuade the Persians to revolt,
and march against Media, and if I or any other chief
man among the Medes is appointed by Astyages to
lead the army against thee, all will be as thou wilt.
They will revolt from the king, and by passing over
to thee attempt to dethrone him. All is ready here;
act therefore, and act quickly.'</p>

<p>"Cyrus considered in what way he could best
persuade the Persians to revolt, and when he discovered
what he believed to be the best plan, he
wrote down his intentions in a letter and summoned
an assembly of the Persians. In their presence he
opened the letter, and read out, that Astyages had
appointed him general of the Persians; then he
added: 'I command that every one of you appear with
a sickle.' And when they were all assembled, furnished
with sickles, Cyrus bade them clear a bushy tract of
land about twenty stades in length and breadth, and
make it fit for cultivation in a single day. When
they had done this, he bade them assemble on the
next day; every one was to come bathed. Then he
caused all the goats, sheep, and oxen of his father to
be got together, slaughtered and dressed, and prepared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
in addition wine and other excellent food, and entertained
the whole of the Persians in a meadow; after
the meal he asked them which they preferred, the
entertainment of that day, or the work of the day
before? They replied that the difference was great:
yesterday they had nothing that was good, to-day
nothing that was bad. Cyrus took up this reply, and
discovered his aims, saying: 'O Persians, thus it is
with you. If ye will follow me, ye shall have these
blessings and many others, without any service; if
ye will not, ye will have troubles without number
like those of yesterday. Follow me, and ye will be
free. I believe that I was born by the favour of
heaven to take this work in hand, and I do not count
you as less than the Medes, in war or any other
service. Since this is so, revolt at once from Astyages.'
The Persians were quite ready to liberate themselves;
they only required a leader, and had long borne the
yoke of the Medes with dissatisfaction."</p>

<p>"When Astyages found what Cyrus had done, he
summoned him into his presence by a messenger.
Cyrus bade the messenger reply that he would come
before Astyages wished. Then the king armed all the
Medes, and, as though blinded by the gods, he named
Harpagus as general, entirely forgetting the injury he
had done to him. When the Medes and Persians
met, some of the Medes, who were not in the conspiracy
fought, but the greater part made no resistance
and fled. Thus the Median army was shamefully
put to rout. But Astyages threatened Cyrus and
said, that even so he should not accomplish his
purpose. The interpreters of dreams among the
magicians who had advised him to let Cyrus go he
impaled, and then armed all who had remained in the
city, young and old, and led them out. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
defeated, lost those whom he commanded, and was
himself taken captive. Harpagus spoke harsh words
to him, and asked how he liked slavery instead of
monarchy with reference to that banquet. Astyages
replied by asking, whether the insurrection was his
own work or that of Cyrus. Harpagus answered that
he had written the letter, and the insurrection was
therefore his doing. Then Astyages said that he was
the most foolish and unjust of men; the most foolish
because when he might have been king, if what had
been done had been his doing, he had given up his
power to another; the most unjust because in revenge
for that banquet he had brought the Medes into
slavery; if the throne must pass to another it would
be more just that it should go to a Mede than a
Persian, but now the innocent Medes were slaves
instead of masters, and the Persians, who had previously
been the servants of the Medes, were their
masters. Thus Astyages lost the throne, after a reign
of thirty-five years, and in consequence of his cruelty
the Medes became subject to the Persians. Cyrus
did no injury to Astyages, but kept him with him till
his death."</p>

<p>In the Persian history of Ctesias the narrative of
the fall of Astyages occupied more than one book.
But we only know that it contradicted the story of
Herodotus, that the daughter of Astyages was not
called Mandane but Amytis, that she was married to
the Median Spitamas, not to the Persian Cambyses,
and that it was not the Median Harpagus but the
Persian Oebares who was Cyrus' counsellor.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> The
loss of these books of Ctesias is compensated by a
fragment of Nicolaus of Damascus, which seems to
give the narrative in a compressed form. It is only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
in a few unimportant points at the close that the
fragment differs from the excerpt of Ctesias which has
come down to us.</p>

<p>"Astyages," so we are told in Nicolaus, "was the
noblest king of the Medes after Arbaces. In his reign
occurred the great revolution by which the dominion
passed from the Medes to the Persians; and the cause
was as follows:&mdash;It was a law among the Medes that
a poor man who went to a rich man to gain a livelihood,
and gave himself up to him, should be fed and
clothed and kept as a slave; if the rich man did not
do his duty in this respect, the poor man might go on
to another. In this way a boy named Cyrus, a Mardian
by birth, came to the servant of the king who was
placed over the sweepers of the palace. He was the
son of Atradates, whose poverty forced him to live by
plunder, and Argoste his mother lived by keeping
goats. He gave himself up to the servant for bread,
and assisted in cleaning the palace, and as he was
industrious the overseer gave him better clothing, and
brought him from among those who swept outside to
those who cleaned the interior, and put him under their
overseer. This man was severe, and often whipped
Cyrus. Cyrus left him, and went to the lighter of the
lamps, who showed him kindness, and brought him
nearer to the king by placing him among those who
bore the lights. As Cyrus distinguished himself there
also, he came to Artembares, the chief butler, who
gave the king his wine. He gladly received Cyrus,
and allowed him to wait on those who ate at the
king's table. Ere long Astyages remarked how deftly
Cyrus waited, and with what a stately air he handed
the goblets, and asked Artembares whence the youth
came who waited so well. 'O king,' he replied, 'he
is thy slave, a Persian by race, of the tribe of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
Mardians, who has given himself over to me in order to
gain a livelihood.' Artembares was old, and once,
when suffering from a fever, he entreated the king to
be allowed to remain at home till he was cured; 'in
my place the youth, whom thou didst praise, will
hand the wine, and if he find favour in thy eyes as
cupbearer, then will I, a eunuch, adopt him as my
son.' Astyages consented, and Artembares gave much
advice to Cyrus, as if to his own son. Cyrus now
stood at the side of the king, and served him by
day and by night, and showed much good sense and
skill. And Astyages allowed him as the son of
Artembares to receive his income, and gave him many
gifts in addition, and Cyrus became great, and his
name was heard everywhere."</p>

<p>"Astyages had a very noble and beautiful daughter,
whom he gave to Spitamas the Mede, adding the
whole of Media as a dowry. Then Cyrus caused his
father and mother to come from the land of the
Medians, and they rejoiced at the greatness of their
son, and his mother told him the dream which she
had while he was yet an unborn child. She had
fallen asleep in the sanctuary when tending her goats,
and in her dream water flowed from her in such
quantities that it became a great stream, and inundated
all Asia, and flowed down to the sea. When
the father heard this, he ordered the dream to be laid
before the Chald&aelig;ans in Babylon. Cyrus sent for the
most skilful of them and laid the dream before him.
He declared that the dream portended great good
fortune for Cyrus, and the highest place in Asia;
Astyages was to know nothing of it, 'otherwise he
will put you to death in some shameful manner, and
me also,' the Babylonian said. They mutually swore
to impart to no one this great and unparalleled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
vision. Cyrus afterwards came to yet greater honours,
and made his father satrap of Persia, and his
mother one of the first among the women in Persia
in wealth and position."</p>

<p>"The Cadusians were at enmity with Astyages.
Their leader was Onaphernes, who was a traitor to his
people in the interests of Astyages, and he despatched
a messenger saying, that he must send a trusty person
with whom to confer about the surrender. Astyages
sent Cyrus to arrange everything with Onaphernes,
bidding him be back again in Ecbatana on the fortieth
day. The interpreter of dreams urged Cyrus to go to
the Cadusians, and filled him with confidence. Cyrus,
who was of a noble and ambitious nature, intended,
with the help of heaven, to bring the Persians to
revolt, to attempt the overthrow of Astyages, and
place confidence in the Babylonian, who was better
acquainted than others with the will of heaven. They
consulted with each other; the Babylonian told
Cyrus that it was destined that he should overthrow
Astyages and his dominion, he knew this for certain;
and Cyrus promised the Babylonian that if this turned
out to be true and he became king, he would make him
a great reward. Cyrus remembered how Arbaces had
previously overthrown Sardanapalus, and obtained his
dominion, and yet the Medes, by whom he was supported,
were not stronger than the Persians. Arbaces
was not stronger than himself, and to him, as to
the other, his fortune had been foretold. With such
thoughts Cyrus passed the boundaries of the land of
the Cadusians. Here he was met by a man who had
been whipped, and carried dung in a basket. Cyrus
took this for a sign, and inquired of the Babylonian,
who told him to ask the man who he was and whence
he came. The man replied that he was a Persian of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
the name of Oebares. Then Cyrus was greatly
pleased; for Oebares signifies one who brings good
news. And the Babylonian told Cyrus that the other
signs were most favourable&mdash;both that he was a
countryman of Cyrus, and that he was carrying horse-dung,
which portended dominion and power. Cyrus
without delay took the man with him."</p>

<p>"Then he came to Onaphernes, and when the
treachery had been arranged by mutual concessions,
he set out on the way back to Persia. He had given
Oebares a horse and Persian clothing, and being convinced
of his friendly disposition he often conversed
with him. Once he said: 'How hard it is to see the
Persians ill-treated by the Medes, and yet they are as
good as they!' 'O Cyrus,' replied the other, 'there
is no great-hearted, high-minded man, to put an
end to the dominion of the Medes over better men
than themselves.' 'Why should there not be such
a man?' asked Cyrus. 'Perhaps there is such an
one,' Oebares replied, 'but want of courage does not
allow him to do it, though he could.' Cyrus pushed
his questions further: 'If such a venturesome man
should appear, how might he accomplish his aim?'
'The first step,' Oebares answered, 'would be to unite
with the Cadusians, who would be willing to join him,
for they love the Persians, and hate the Medes; then
he must rouse the Persians, who are about 40,000 in
number, and arm them; their treatment by the Medes
will prepare them for this. Their land also is most
suitable, being full of mountains and rocks, and even
if the Medes should invade it, they will be driven
back with loss.' Then Cyrus asked: 'Suppose that
this man should appear, would you join in the danger
with him?' Oebares replied: 'Most readily, if you
were the man to take the matter in hand; your father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
is the ruler of Persia, so that you have the best place
of refuge, and are the strongest. If not you, who is
it to be?' As Cyrus saw from this that Oebares was
a cautious and brave man, who placed all his hopes in
him, he revealed his plan and consulted him. Oebares
encouraged him, and gave him good counsel to guide
him. He urged Cyrus to send to his father Atradates
and entreat him to arm the Persians, apparently to aid
the king against the Cadusians, but in truth to revolt
against Astyages; then he must ask Astyages for
permission to visit Persia for some days, in order to
offer the sacrifice which he had vowed for the safety
of the king, and at the same time for his father
who was sick. If he obtained his request he must set
manfully to work; when a man ventures in a great
enterprise it is no hardship to venture his life, and if
need be to lose it, for this happens even to those who
do nothing. Cyrus was pleased at the man's resolute
frame of mind, and now told him his mother's dream
and the interpretation of the Babylonian. Oebares
then inflamed his spirit yet more, but cunning as he
was, he bade him take care that the Babylonian did
not tell the dream to the king&mdash;'if you will not
permit his death, which would be the safest thing.'
'That be far from me,' said Cyrus. Filled with alarm
that the Babylonian would betray the dream to
Astyages, Oebares gave out that according to ancestral
custom he would offer sacrifice to the goddess of the
moon at night, and obtained of Cyrus all that he
required for the purpose&mdash;incense, wine, and pillows&mdash;and
arranged that Cyrus should take no part in the
sacrifice. In his tent he dug a deep trench, put thick
pillows over it, and invited the Babylonian to a
banquet, and made him intoxicated. When he sank
down on the pillows, he threw him into the trench,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
and his servants with him. In the morning, Oebares
went quietly on with Cyrus, who soon inquired for
the Babylonian. Oebares acknowledged what he had
done; he could find no other way of escape for Cyrus
and his children. Cyrus was deeply distressed, and
even more angry, and would not see Oebares any more,
but at length he again placed his confidence in him."</p>

<p>"When Cyrus was again with Astyages, Oebares
reminded him of his advice. Cyrus followed it, sent
to Persia, and when he found that all was ready, asked
Astyages, under the pretext that Oebares had suggested,
for permission to go to Persia. The king would
not let him go. Then Cyrus betook himself to the
most trusty of the eunuchs; when a favourable
moment came, he was to obtain permission for the
journey to Persia. One day when Cyrus found the
king in the best of humours and cheered with wine,
he gave the eunuch a sign, and the latter said to the
king: 'Cyrus asks to perform the sacrifice, which
he has vowed for thee in Persia, that thou mightest
continue gracious to him, and for permission to visit
his sick father.' The king called for Cyrus, and with
a smile, gave him permission of absence for five
months; in the sixth month he was to return. Cyrus
bowed in gratitude before the king, appointed Tiridates
as butler to the king during his absence, and
early on the next morning he set out to Persia."</p>

<p>"In vain had the wife of the slain Babylonian
waited for his return to Ecbatana; Oebares told her
that robbers had killed him. Then she became the
wife of the brother of her husband, and when she
heard that Cyrus had gone to Persia, she remembered
that her first husband had once confided to her the
dream of the mother of Cyrus, and its interpretation.
She related this to her husband, who at once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
went to Astyages, told him all, and added that Cyrus
had obviously gone to Persia with a view of preparing
for the execution of that which the dream had
portended. The king was seized with great anxiety,
and the Babylonian advised him to put Cyrus to death
as soon as he returned. Towards evening Astyages
caused his concubines to dance and play before him
while drinking wine. One of the players sang: 'The
lion has let the boar which he had in his power go
forth to the pasture. There he will become strong and
give great trouble to the lion, and at length he, the
weaker, will overcome the stronger.' Astyages applied
this song to himself and Cyrus, and on the spot sent
300 horsemen to bring him back; if he would not
obey they were to cut off his head and bring that.
When the horsemen brought to Cyrus the commands
of Astyages, he answered cunningly, perhaps on the
advice of Oebares: 'Why should I not return as my
lord summons me? To-day we will feast; to-morrow
morning we will set out.' This met with their
approval. After the manner of the Persians, Cyrus
caused many oxen and other animals to be slain in
sacrifice, feasted the horsemen, and made them intoxicated;
at the same time he sent a message to his
father to send at once 1000 cavalry and 5000 foot-soldiers
to the city of Hyrba which lay on the way,
and to arm the rest of the Persians as quickly as
possible in such a way that it should seem to be done
by command of the king. His true aims he did
not communicate to him. In the night he and
Oebares took horse, just as they were, hastened to
Hyrba, armed the inhabitants, and drew out those
whom Atradates had sent in order for battle. When
the horsemen of Astyages had slept off their debauch
on the following morning, and found that Cyrus had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
disappeared, they pursued him and came to Hyrba.
Here Cyrus first displayed his bravery, for with his
Persians he slew 250 of the horse of Astyages. The
remainder escaped, and brought the news to Astyages.
'Woe is me!' cried the king striking his thigh, 'that
I, well knowing that we should not do good to the
evil, have allowed myself to be carried away by clever
speeches, and have raised up this Mardian to be such
a mischief to me. Still, he shall not succeed.' He
called his generals and bade them assemble the army,
and led out against the Persians nearly 1,000,000
foot-soldiers, 200,000 horse, and 3000 chariots."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the army under Atradates, who was
now fully instructed, was collected: 300,000 infantry,
50,000 horse, and 100 chariots. Cyrus encouraged
the Persians, and Oebares seized the passes of the
mountain and the heights, built lines, and brought
the people from the open cities into such as were
well fortified. Astyages burned down the abandoned
cities, summoned Atradates and Cyrus to submission,
and taunted them with their former beggary. Cyrus
replied that Astyages did not recognise the power of
the gods, which forced them, goat-herds as they were,
to accomplish what was destined to be done. As he
had done them kindness, they bade him lead back the
Medes, and give their freedom to the Persians who
were better than the Medes. Thus it came to a battle.
Astyages, surrounded by 20,000 of his body-guard,
looked on: among the Persians Atradates had the
right, and Oebares the left, wing; Cyrus, surrounded
by the bravest warriors, was in the centre. The Persians
defended themselves bravely, and slew many of
the Medes, so that Astyages cried out on his throne:
'How bravely these "terebinth-eaters" fight!' But at
length the Persians were overpowered by numbers, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
driven into the city before which they fought. Cyrus
and Oebares advised to send the women and children
to Pasargadae, which is the loftiest mountain, and renew
the battle on the next day: 'If we are defeated
we must all die, and if that must be so it is better to
fall in victory and for the freedom of our country.'
Then all were filled with hatred and anger against the
Medes, and when the morning came and the gates were
opened, all marched out; Atradates alone remained
with the old men in the city to defend the walls. But
while Cyrus and Oebares were fighting in the field,
Astyages caused 100,000 men to go round and attack
the Persian army in the rear. The attack succeeded.
Atradates fell covered with wounds into the hands of
the Medes.  Astyages said to him: 'An excellent
satrap are you; is it thus that you thank me, you and
your son, for what I have done for you?' Atradates,
almost at the last gasp, replied: 'I know not, O king,
what deity has roused this frenzy in my son; put me
not to the torture, I shall soon die.' Astyages had
compassion on him and said: 'I will not put you to
the torture; I know that if your son had followed
your advice, he would not have done such things.'
Atradates died, and Astyages gave him an honourable
burial.  Meanwhile Cyrus and Oebares after a brave
struggle had been compelled to retire to Pasargadae.
The mountain was very high and with steep sides, and
the way to it led through narrow passes, which were
here and there overtopped by high walls of rock.
Oebares defended the passes with 10,000 heavy-armed
men. As it was impossible to force a way through,
Astyages gave command that 100,000 men should go
round the mountain, and seek for a pass there and
climb the mountain. This movement compelled Cyrus
and Oebares to seek shelter during the night on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
lower hill for the army, together with the women and
children. Astyages followed quickly, and his army
was already between the two mountains, and bravely
attacked that held by the Persians, the approach to
which, lying through deep gorges, thick oak forests,
and wild olive trees, was very difficult. The Persians
fought still more bravely; in one place Cyrus dashed
forward, and in another Oebares, who urged them not
to let their wives, mothers, and old men be massacred
and tortured by the Medes. So they rushed down
with a cry, and when their javelins failed, they threw
down stones in great numbers. The Medes were
driven back, and Cyrus chanced to come to the house
in which he once lived with his father as a boy, when
he pastured goats. He kindled a fire of cypress and
laurel-wood, and offered the sacrifice of the man who
is distressed and in desperate circumstances. Then
followed thunder and lightning, and when Cyrus sank
down in prayer, birds of good omen settled on the
roof, as a sign that he would again reach Pasargadae.
So the Persians remained for the night on the
mountain, and when on the following morning the
Medes renewed the attack, they fought yet more
bravely, relying on the happy omens. But Astyages
placed 50,000 men at the foot of the mountain behind
those who were attacking, and bade them slay all who
came down. Thus pressed, the Medes fought more
zealously than on the previous day, and the Persians
retired to the top of the mountain on which were
their women and children. These ran to meet the
fugitives, and cried out to them, 'Cowards, whither
would ye fly, will ye creep back into the bosoms that
bore you?' Seized with shame, the Persians turned,
and in one onslaught drove the Medes down the
mountain, and slew sixty thousand of them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Astyages did not retire from the siege of the
mountain. Cyrus had still need of much cunning and
bravery before he succeeded in defeating Astyages
and taking the camp of the Medes. On that day,
Cyrus went into the tent of Astyages, seated himself
on his throne, and took the sceptre amid the acclamations
of the Persians; and Oebares put the king's
kidaris on his head with the words: 'Thou art more
worthy to bear it; the gods give it to thee for thy
virtue, and grant the Persians to rule over the Medes.'
The treasures of Astyages, which the Persians found in
the camp of the Medes, were brought to Pasargadae
under the care of Oebares; but even those which
they found in the tents of the other Medes were
enormous. It was not long before the intelligence of
the defeat and flight of Astyages spread abroad, and
nations as well as individuals deserted him. First of
all Artasyras, the chief of the Hyrcanians, came, with
50,000 men, and recognised Cyrus as king; afterwards
came the chiefs of the Parthians, Sac&aelig;, Bactrians, and
other nations, each seeking to arrive before the other.
Only a few faithful men remained with Astyages, and
when Cyrus marched against him he was easily overcome.
Then Cyrus gained possession of Ecbatana.
There the daughter of Astyages and her husband
Spitamas were taken captive with their two sons.
But Astyages could not be found; Amytis and
Spitamas had hidden him in the palace in the woodwork
of the roof. Then Cyrus commanded that
Amytis, her husband, and her children should be
tortured that they might confess where Astyages was,
but he came forward of his own will to prevent the
torture. Spitamas was beheaded, because he had lied,
and said that he did not know the hiding-place of
Astyages; Amytis Cyrus took for his wife. He loosed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
from Astyages the heavy chains which Oebares had
put upon him, honoured him as a father, and made
him satrap of the Barcanians."<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>According to Deinon, who wrote in the first half of
the fourth century <small>B.C.</small>, Cyrus was first governor of
the staff-bearers of Astyages, and then of his body-guard.
In a dream he had thrice seen the sun at
his feet, and thrice stretched out his arms to grasp it,
and the magicians had interpreted this dream to the
effect that he would reign for thrice ten years. When
Astyages had given Cyrus leave to go to Persia, and
he had availed himself of it, the king sent for Angares,
the most famous of the Median minstrels, in order to
sing before him and his company at the banquet.
After reciting the usual songs, Angares at last said:
"The great beast of prey, more mighty than a wild
boar, is let loose in the swamps; when he is master
of his land, he will with ease fight against many."
And when Astyages asked, "What wild beast is
this?" Angares answered: "Cyrus the Persian."
Then Astyages, regarding the suspicion as well-founded,
sent to fetch Cyrus back, but failed to
recover him.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>

<p>The narrative of Pompeius Trogus has been preserved
in excerpts only. Astyages had a daughter,
but no male heirs. From her bosom, he saw, in a
dream, a vine growing, of which the branches overshadowed
all Asia. The interpreters of dreams declared
that this vision portended the greatness of
the grandson whom his daughter would bring forth,
but it also involved the loss of the empire to him.
To be rid of this fear, Astyages had not given his
daughter to any eminent man, nor even to a Mede<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>&mdash;that
there might not be rank on the father's side
as well as on the mother's, to excite the ambition of
his grandson&mdash;but to Cambyses, a man of middle
station, in the then unknown nation of the Persians.
Even this did not remove the alarm of Astyages;
when his daughter was pregnant he sent for her in
order to have her child put to death before his
eyes. When a boy was born he gave him to Harpagus,
his trusted friend, to be put to death. But
Harpagus, fearing that the daughter of Astyages if
she should come to the throne would avenge on him
the death of her son, gave the child to the herdman
of the king, and bade him expose it. The herdman
obeyed, but when his wife heard of the matter, she
urged her husband to fetch the child and show it to
her. Wearied by her entreaties, the herdman went
back into the forest, and there found a dog beside the
child, suckling it, and defending it from the beasts of
prey. He took it up and carried it to his fold, while
the dog followed in much distress. When the herdman's
wife took it in her arms, the child smiled on
her as though it had known her, and it was so full
of life and sweet smiles that the woman induced her
husband to expose her own child in place of the
grandson of the king. After this the excerpt goes
on to relate, like Herodotus, the game of the boys,
the answer of Cyrus, the revenge of Astyages on
Harpagus, the letter in the hare's belly, in which
Harpagus imparts to Cyrus his plan for the desertion
of the Medes to the Persians. When Cyrus had
received and read this letter in Persepolis, a dream
also urged the enterprise upon him, but at the same
time bade him take as his associate the man whom
he met first on the following day. Next day, before
dawn, Cyrus went on a journey, and met a slave of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
the name of Oebares, belonging to the house of a
Mede. When Cyrus found that he was a Persian by
birth, he took his chains off and turned back with him
to Persepolis. Cyrus then assembled the Persians.
On the first day he made them cut down a wood on
the way, and on the second he entertained them.
Astyages sends Harpagus against them, and he
passes over to their side with the army entrusted to
him. Astyages now marches out in person, after summoning
all his forces, against Persia. The struggle
was severe. Astyages placed a portion of his army
in the rear of his forces, and told the latter that they
must try whether they could not break through the
ranks of the enemy in battle more easily than through
the ranks behind them in flight. The Medes attacked
with great spirit; the Persians were forced back to
their wives and children, by whom they were again
driven into the battle with the cry: Would they fly
for refuge into the bosoms of their mothers and wives?
They put the Medes to flight. Here the excerpt of
Justin breaks off, though he represents Astyages as
having been taken prisoner in this battle after the
rout. Cyrus merely took the government from him;
he treated him as his grandfather, and made him
satrap of the Hyrcanians; Oebares he made ruler of
Persia, and gave him his sister in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>Polyaenus repeats the narrative of Herodotus about
the manner in which Cyrus induced the Persians to
revolt. Then followed a war between the Medes and
Persians, and Cyrus was three times defeated. As the
women and children of the Persians were at Pasargadae,
Cyrus was compelled to risk another battle in the
neighbourhood of this place. The Persians were again
put to flight; Oebares was retreating when the women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
met the fugitives, with the cry already quoted. The
Persians halted; and as the Medes were pursuing
without order, the Persians gained such a victory that
no further battle was needed to decide the question of
the throne.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> Anaximenes of Lampsacus also relates
that Cyrus had built Pasargadae at the place where
he had overcome Astyages in battle. Strabo tells us:
"Cyrus held Pasargadae in honour, for it was there
that he conquered Astyages in the final battle, and
became ruler of all Asia in his place, and he built
a city and a palace in remembrance of the victory."<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
Plutarch tells us: When Cyrus revolted from Astyages
and the Medes he was three times conquered in battle,
and when the Persians fled into the city, the enemy
had almost succeeded in forcing an entrance with them,
when the women came out to meet them. The cry of
the women brought about a change in the battle, and
for this reason Cyrus made a law that as often as the
king came into the city of Pasargadae, every woman
should receive a piece of gold. Ochus marched past
the city to evade the law; but Alexander twice
entered Pasargadae, and gave double to all the women
that were with child.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> In all these narratives the
land of the Persians is the scene of the decisive
conflict.</p>

<p>Only a few short fragments remain of the account<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
given by Diodorus of the overthrow of Astyages. With
him Cyrus is the son of Mandane, the daughter of
Astyages, and Cambyses. His father brought him
up as a king, and inflamed him with a desire for
the mightiest achievements. As a young man he displayed
a capacity in advance of his years, and clearly
showed that he would undertake the most important
enterprises. He was the first man of his time in
bravery, wisdom, and all other virtues. Another fragment
obviously comes after the defeat, which, according
to Nicolaus, Astyages suffered in the final battle
at Pasargadae. When defeated, Astyages, though he
had himself disgracefully turned and fled, showed
ferocious anger against his army. He deposed all the
commanders and elected others in their place. Those
who were to blame for the flight, he executed one
and all, thinking that he should thus compel the
others to show themselves brave men in danger.
"For he was cruel and harsh in character. But he
did not terrify the multitude by this severity; on the
other hand, by the exasperation which such violence
and caprice excited in every one, he roused them to a
desire for revolution and deposition. The troops met
in their divisions; treasonable speeches were uttered,
and the majority urged each other to vengeance."<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>Xenophon, it is true, has not written a history of
Cyrus, but has given a description of his life from
his knowledge of the Persian life and character,
and the conclusions he deduced therefrom, as to the
possible origin of the empire, in order to explain and
realise to the Greeks the difficulty which they found
it so hard to solve&mdash;the manner in which great
nations could form one community and be governed
by one person.  With him Cyrus is the son of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
Cambyses, who is the king of the Persians, and
Mandane the daughter of Astyages of Media, whom
Xenophon represents as reigning before Cyaxares.
When Cyrus was twelve years of age, his mother went
with him to Media, in order to show him to his grandfather,
whom the boy astonished by his apt answers.
At the age of sixteen, Cyrus performs his first deeds
of arms. When Astyages died, he was succeeded on
the throne by his son Cyaxares, the brother of Mandane.
He entreats Cambyses to aid him against the
Assyrians; Cambyses sends Cyrus, by whose services
the Medes are defeated. After this he conquered
the Lydians, who had come to aid the Assyrians
against the Medes, and took Babylon; and his uncle
Cyaxares, whom Xenophon does not describe as a
pattern ruler, gives him his daughter in marriage,
and Media as a dowry, for he was without male
children. Cambyses and Mandane assented to this
arrangement. After the death of Cambyses, Cyrus
became king of Persia, and on the death of Cyaxares,
Media also became his.</p>

<p>The Armenians also narrate the fall of Astyages.
Moses of Chorene (I. 513) tells us that he only related
the stories of the Persians to please his patron
Sahak (Isaac) Bagratuni, and gave them a meaning
which they did not possess. Biurasp Asdahag lived
at the time of Nimrod, and the person whom the
Persians in their stories call the child of Satan,
served him; and with regard to the dragon, or the
changing of Asdahag into a dragon, the truth was
that he sacrificed men in infinite numbers to the
dragon, till the multitude grew weary, overpowered
him, and threw him into a trench filled with bitumen.
Moses further tells us: The ninth descendant of
Baroir of Armenia (I. 515), King Tigran, was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
mightiest of all the princes of Armenia, and helped
Cyrus to overthrow the kingdom of the Medes.
Tigran was pledged by treaties to Asdahag (Astyages)
the king of the Medians, and when he united with
Cyrus, Astyages had an evil dream. He saw a high
mountain surrounded by snow and ice, as in the land
of the son of Haikhs (I. 513). On the summit of the
mountain, a woman in purple, covered with a sky-blue
veil, brought forth three heroes at once: one, carried
on a lion, dashed toward the west; the second, on a
leopard, to the north; the third, on a monstrous
dragon, to Media. With this Asdahag fought in the
dream: they shed a sea of blood, and pierced each
other with their lances.  Asdahag explained this
dream to mean that he had to expect an attack from
Tigran, the king of Armenia.  To prevent this, and
secretly to destroy Tigran, Asdahag sought Tigran's
sister, Tigranuhi, in marriage, obtained her, and held
her in great honour. Then he asked for a meeting with
Tigran. But Tigranuhi had perceived the duplicity of
Asdahag, and warned her brother. He collected the
best warriors of great and little Armenia, and marched
against the Medes. The war continued for four
months, till Tigran in a hand-to-hand conflict pierced
the iron armour of Asdahag with his lance. The death
of Asdahag put an end to the battle and the war,
and Tigran led his sister back to Armenia, where she
became the ancestress of the race of Osdan. Anuish
(Aryanis), the first wife of Astyages, and a number of
young princesses and boys, more than 10,000 in all,
Tigranes brought to Armenia, and settled there to
the east of the great mountain, towards the land of
Koghten, in the plain of Ajtnayan, as far as Nakhjevan.
In the songs of the people of Koghten, the
descendants of Astyages are spoken of in an alle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>gorical
manner, as the descendants of the dragon;
for Astyages (Asdahag) in our language means the
dragon.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> As has been shown, the Armenians were
closely allied to the people of Iran in language, character,
and religious worship. It cannot therefore
astonish us that the legends of Iran are known to
them. What Moses tells us of Biurasp Asdahag and
his serpents rests on the myth in the Avesta of the
serpent Azhi dahaka, the Zohak of the later form
of Iranian legend (p. 250). The epithet which Moses
gives to Asdahag, Biurasp, is also of Iranian origin;
Baevara&ccedil;pa means the lord of 10,000 horses. That
the descendants of Astyages are spoken of in the
national legend of Armenia as the descendants of
the dragon, shows that the Armenians had confounded
Astyages of Media with Azhi dahaka or
Zohak. The Armenians can only claim as their own
the legend of King Tigran, who overcomes and slays
Asdahag of Media. They ascribe to their princes the
overthrow of the Medes. As already remarked, the
Armenian legend of Tigran must come down from
an early date. Xenophon makes Tigran the son
of the king of Armenia, the most faithful helper and
associate of Cyrus.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>Leaving out of sight the romance of Xenophon,
and the Armenian tradition, which involve special
hypotheses, the accounts in the West of the fall of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
Astyages go back to two distinct versions, one of which
we have in the narrative of Herodotus, the other in
the narrative of Ctesias-Nicolaus, which is presupposed
in Deinon and Polyaenus. In Trogus we have a third
version, which combines the two. So far as Justin's
excerpt allows us to form an opinion, this version, and
the fragments of Diodorus, are based upon the Persian
history of Deinon. The introduction is distinguished
from the account of Herodotus by the fact that only
one dream of Astyages is mentioned; that Cyrus is
already exposed, and a dog is suckling him before
the herdsman's wife, whose name was "dog," brings
him up; then follows the story of Herodotus, including
the letter, which Harpagus sends to Cyrus in
the hare's belly. At this point Trogus passes into the
account of Nicolaus; he represents Cyrus as receiving
in a dream the exhortation to rise against Astyages,
and to take the first man he meets as his associate.
Cyrus meets Oebares, though not, it is true, on the
borders of the Cadusians. The place of the horsemen,
who in Nicolaus are first sent by Astyages, is
taken in Trogus by the march of Harpagus, and his
desertion to Cyrus; then follows the narrative of the
war, which in the most essential traits agrees with the
version of Ctesias-Nicolaus. From Deinon's fragments
we shall add to the excerpt from Trogus, that
Cyrus before his rebellion had served at the court
of Astyages as overseer of the staff-bearers, and then
of the body-guard; that Astyages was warned by
Angares; and, finally, the defection of the Medes after
the battle of Pasargadae, as given in the fragments
of Diodorus.</p>

<p>The detail and liveliness of the traits in the accounts
of Herodotus and Ctesias-Nicolaus, in the fragment
of Deinon, and the narrative of Trogus&mdash;the warnings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
and portents&mdash;the dialogues and speeches of the
action&mdash;the letter:&mdash;all these point to poetical sources.
We found that the accounts of Ctesias of the foundation,
rise, and fall of Assyria, and of the rise of
Media, were based upon poems, and here also, beyond
doubt, poetic traditions form the groundwork. Herodotus,
at the beginning of his narrative, tells us: "I
write these matters from the accounts given by some
of the Persians, who do not exaggerate the life of
Cyrus, but wish to narrate the order of events; I am
aware that three other different accounts of the life of
Cyrus are in existence."<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> Xenophon tells us that
Cyrus "is even now the theme of song among the
barbarians."<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> In Deinon's fragment it is Angares, the
most famous of the Median minstrels, who, while
singing at the table of Astyages, warns him in a
poetical figure against Cyrus (p. 354); in the account
of Nicolaus it is one of the singing women, from whom,
at the same time and in a similar figure, this warning
comes. At the court of the Sassanids there were
singing women who sang to the kings the achievements
of old days. Ibn-al-Hareth brought women of
this kind from the court of Chosru Nushirvan to the
Koreishites, and they sang the deeds of Rustem.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>
According to these statements and indications we
may regard it as certain that the elevation of Cyrus
and the fall of Astyages was celebrated in song
among the Persians and Medes. In spite of the differences
between the three narratives, certain traits are
common to all.  In all dreams announce the future
greatness of Cyrus; in Herodotus these appear to
Astyages; in Nicolaus, to the mother of Cyrus; in
Deinon and Trogus, to Cyrus also. In Herodotus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
Cambyses is rich in flocks, in Nicolaus the mother of
Cyrus tends goats; in Herodotus Cambyses is of a
quiet disposition, in Nicolaus he is driven by his son
to revolt, and finally disowns the enterprise. All three
narratives lay stress on the warnings given to Astyages
against Cyrus, though in different ways; all mark
strongly the early personal valour of Cyrus, which
Xenophon also celebrates. Artembares the Mede is
found both in Herodotus and Nicolaus, though in a
different relation to Cyrus. In all three accounts a
counsellor&mdash;Harpagus in the one case, Oebares in the
other&mdash;exercises the greatest influence on the resolutions
of Cyrus. Herodotus and Nicolaus mark the cunning
of Cyrus as opposed to Astyages; in both Cyrus gives
out that he is carrying out the king's orders in arming
the Persians. In Herodotus Cyrus tells the Persians
that he does not consider them worse men than the
Medes, and they revolt "because they have now got a
leader in Cyrus." In Nicolaus Cyrus asks whether
there is not a leader who can put an end to the rule
of the Medes over better men than themselves. In
both the dominion of the Medes has long been hated
by the Persians. In both before the beginning of
the struggle Astyages commands Cyrus to appear
before him.  In Herodotus Astyages says, when
Harpagus has passed over to Cyrus and the Median
army has broken up, that "he shall not succeed;"
and in Nicolaus he uses the same words after the
first defeat of his horsemen. In Herodotus it is the
cruelty of Astyages to Harpagus, and his severity
towards the Medes, which cost him his throne; in
Diodorus the army revolts, even after brave fighting,
from Astyages because he cruelly revenges upon
them the defeat at Pasargadae. In all three accounts
Cyrus does no harm to Astyages after his victory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us set aside the poetical colours in the account
of Herodotus in order to test its coherence. What
alarm could Astyages, who was without male heirs,
feel at the announcement that his daughter's son
would one day rule over all Asia, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> would still
further extend the dominion of the Medes? In the
second dream, which portends no more than the first,
a reason is given for the alarm; the interpreters
declare that the dream signifies that Astyages will
lose his throne. If Astyages had reason to fear the
yet unborn child of his daughter, the obvious remedy
was not to allow her to marry. Nevertheless she is
married, not to a Mede, but to a man of the subject
races, a Persian of a good family, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of noble
descent, wealthy, but "quiet in his disposition."
This was equivalent to taking the Persian into the
royal family, giving up to him or his son the right
of succession, bringing the crown of Media into the
possession of a stranger, and allowing the kingdom to
pass from the Medes to the Persians. Even if such
perversity could occur to Astyages the Medes were
not likely to permit it, when the Magians tell Astyages,
in Herodotus, how anxious they are that the dominion
should not fall into the hands of a Persian. It is
true that Herodotus represents Harpagus some twenty
or thirty years later as persuading the chief Medes,
and persuading them singly, that Astyages must be
overthrown, and the Persian made king, but this is
simply incredible. After this marvellous marriage of
the heiress to the throne with a Persian, Cambyses is
not brought to Ecbatana to the court, but remains
in Persia, and no harm is done to the dreaded son of
the marriage, even when his real origin has been
discovered. Nay, more, the boy who at an early age
discovers high aims, and a resolute will, is not even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
brought to the court to be under the eye of Astyages,
but is sent back to Persia to his father, and by his
means Harpagus is able to bring Persia to revolt.
The letter hidden in the hare's belly obviously arose
from an anticipation of the supervision of the great
roads which was introduced at a later time by the
Ach&aelig;menids. But what reason had Cyrus to cause
the Persians to revolt? According to Herodotus
Cambyses is the son-in-law, and hence the heir, of
Astyages. Cyrus will succeed his father as heir to
the Median throne, why then should he rebel against
his aged grandfather?&mdash;why should he seek by hazard,
danger, and bloodshed, a crown which by inheritance
must soon come to Cambyses or Cyrus?<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>In the narrative of Herodotus Cyrus is no more
than an instrument in the hands of Harpagus. The
crime of Astyages against Harpagus; the well-merited
punishment of this crime by his own imprisonment
and loss of empire, form the hinge of the narrative,
which at the same time brings into prominence the
doctrine that no one, even though warned, can escape
his doom. It is not probable that there were songs
among the Persians or Medes, which illustrated Herodotus'
view of the unavoidable <i>Nemesis</i> which governs
the actions and fortunes of men; or that Persian
poems would represent Cyrus as the son of a Median
mother. In them the Persians merely glorified the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
founder of their freedom and supremacy, of whom, as
we know, they cherished the most grateful memories.
But the Medes might possess poems in which the
change of empire was treated from their point of
view; they might attempt to make the loss of empire
appear less painful, the dishonour of defeat by the
Persians less degrading. To be overthrown by a man
belonging to the subject race was bitter. Hence the
Medes could avail themselves of a change frequent in
the East, and represent Cyrus as a scion of their
own royal house. The Egyptians maintained that
Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, who reduced them to
subjection, was the son of Cyrus and the daughter of
their own Pharaoh Hophra.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> This was mere invention;
and the Medes must have found their version
the more easy to maintain, because Cyrus spared
Astyages after the defeat, and took his daughter into
his harem. And if it was not the arms of the Persians,
but rather the treachery of a distinguished
Mede, the discontent of the chiefs of Media with a
cruel king, that decided the struggle between the
Persians and Medes, the submission became thus less
intolerable to the pride of the Medes. If a distinguished
Mede had been at variance with Astyages, and
in the last moment of the battle had gone over to
Cyrus,&mdash;much could be made of the desertion in
Median poems. If after his victory Cyrus reposed
great confidence in an eminent Mede, this might be
made a ground for previous treachery to Astyages.
A few years after his victory Cyrus entrusted to the
Mede Harpagus, the leadership of the army, the
subjugation and maintenance of far distant regions.
If the legend of the Persians represented Ach&aelig;menes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
the ancestor of their princely race, as being fed by
an eagle (p. 327), their poems would speak of the
founder of their dominion as distinguished by divine
honours, and surround his birth and youth with
happy omens of the future. These traits the Medes
could use for their own purposes as warnings vouchsafed
to Astyages. If the Persians represented Cyrus
as suckled by a dog, the favoured creature of Auramazda,
the Medes carried the subject further, and
spoke of the exposing of Cyrus, which was then
brought into combination with the enmity of Harpagus
to Astyages; the origin of this was the refusal
of Harpagus to put the Persian boy to death,
which Astyages punished by the Thyestean banquet.
Thus owing to the crime of Astyages, Harpagus
their own countryman became filled with desire for
vengeance; he is the counsellor of Cyrus, the author
and leader of the revolt.</p>

<p>Median poetry of this kind has been followed by
Herodotus. He has told us already that he would
narrate the life of Cyrus as it was given by the
Persians, who had no desire to exaggerate their
account, but these Persians are undoubtedly the
Medes. The Median origin of his story is placed
beyond doubt by the words which the captive Astyages
addresses to Harpagus, and by the fact that
with him it is a Mede who is the decisive counsellor
and guide of Cyrus, while in the other version it is a
Persian. Beside the reason given by Herodotus himself
for choosing this version, others no doubt had
influence. The Delphian oracle bade Cr&#339;sus take to
flight "whenever a mule should govern the Medes."
According to the Medes Cyrus was the son of a
Persian father and Median mother. The sufferings
and acts of Harpagus formed the centre of the Median<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
version, and he was only too well known to the
Greeks on the west coast of Asia Minor. With the
warning portents, and the exposure of Cyrus, the
Median version brought Herodotus on the familiar
ground of Greek legend, in which similar oracles,
futile exposing of children, and deceptive explanations
were common. Finally, the vengeance which overtook
Astyages suits the ethical feeling of Herodotus.
We may assume therefore that his narrative faithfully
represents the contents of Median poems. These
could already have changed the dog which was
said to have suckled Cyrus into the herdman's wife,
who was called by the name of "dog." But inasmuch
as Herodotus does not "intend to exaggerate,"
as he observes that "the dog was everything in
the mouth of Cyrus," and "his parents caught this
up in order to represent the preservation of Cyrus
as a work of the gods,"&mdash;as he further remarks "that
Cyrus owing to his origin was regarded as more than
human,"<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>&mdash;this rationalising turn may have proceeded
from the historian himself. In the Persian tradition
Cyrus was certainly suckled and guarded by the dog,
and this trait is retained in the account of Deinon-Trogus,
though united with the story of the exposure.
But Deinon has at the same time proved the
exposure impossible, for he states that Cyrus came
to the throne in his fortieth year, and lived till his
seventieth.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> If this were true, the exposure and the
command of Astyages respecting it would fall to the
ground, for Cyrus would have seen the light in the
year 599 <small>B.C.</small>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> some years before the accession of
Astyages, even if we allow the latter the longer reign
which Eusebius assigns to him.</p>

<p>If the story of Herodotus is governed by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
conception of the unavoidable punishment of crime,
the connecting clue in the story of Nicolaus is the
rise of a beggar-boy of the lowest origin by skill and
industry, by cunning and bravery, by endurance in the
greatest danger, and final victory in the most severe
struggles. Cyrus is the son of humble parents; his
father is driven by want to robbery, his mother tends
goats; they belong to the lowest tribe of the Persians,
the marauding Mardians whom we have found in the
mountains of south-western Persia (p. 323). Hunger
drives the boy from the goat-pasture to Ecbatana.
Beginning as a sweeper of the palace, he works his
way step by step upwards by address and industry to
the highest offices at the court, so that he can make
his father satrap of Persia and his mother the most
distinguished lady in Persia. Then the dream of his
mother, and the interpretation given of it by the
Babylonian, plant ambition in his soul, which is
strengthened by the happy portent, vouchsafed to
him on his mission to the chief of the Cadusians, and
the advice of Oebares. He succeeds in persuading
Astyages to grant him permission to visit his parents
in Persia; when too late, Astyages is warned by the
wife of the Babylonian, and the words of the singing-woman
(Angares in Deinon). A fierce war breaks
out. The father of Cyrus is taken captive, and in
his last moments disavows the attempt of his son.
Defeated again and again, the Persians in their last
refuge at Pasargadae are reduced to the greatest
distress. Then fortune turns; the Medes are driven
back and defeated in numerous engagements, and
Oebares can at length place the crown on the head of
Cyrus in the tent of Astyages.</p>

<p>If Xenophon in his book on Cyrus sought to make
it clear to the Greeks, by what personal and material<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
means Cyrus was able to conquer Asia, Ctesias or
Nicolaus will show pragmatically how a beggar-boy
rose step by step to be lord of the continent. He says
nothing of the relationship of Astyages and Cyrus, or
of the princely origin of Cyrus, or of his exposure, or
of the dog: Cyrus owes his successes to himself and
the gods. However impossible it may be that this
introduction and the whole tendency of the narrative
can be borrowed from the tradition of the Persians;
however certain that Cyrus the beggar-boy is an
invention of the Greeks, to point the contrast between
beginning and end, and make the subject more interesting;
yet if only we give another turn to the
introduction, we have the Persian account before us in
the narrative of Nicolaus, as we have the Median in
the account of Herodotus&mdash;and a mixture of the two
in the excerpt from Trogus. The Persian version is
from the first marked in Ctesias and Nicolaus by the
fact that they do not represent Cyrus as the descendant
of Astyages. Moreover, the parallel between the
fall of the Assyrians and the fall of the Median empire
cannot be mistaken. "We must narrate the great
change brought about by the transition of the dominion
to the Persians"&mdash;such is the beginning of the
account of Nicolaus. This parallel can only have
arisen from Persian minstrels. They had to show
that the task of Cyrus was great, and more difficult
than that of Arbaces. They had to lay the greatest
stress on the personal excellence of Cyrus in order
to raise him above the level of Arbaces. The latter,
guided by the advice of the viceroy of Babylon and
aided by the Babylonians, had proved the conqueror.
The arts of the Chald&aelig;ans were certainly respected
and used in Iran; they must have been sought after
and employed as a poetic motive. It was to carry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
out the parallel that the Persian songs gave Cyrus
a Babylonian adviser; yet they represent the counsel
and influence of this Babylonian as entirely removed
by a Persian of far greater importance, and utterly
thrown into the shade.  The emphasis which the
Persian songs laid on the personal virtue of Cyrus
misled the Greeks into making an attempt at the
biography of the beggar-boy, and so rendered this
change easier. Atradates, the name given by Nicolaus
to the father of Cyrus, is no doubt taken from an
epithet of Cyrus himself. Strabo tells us that Cyrus
was originally called Atradates; the word is the
old Persian <i>atriyadata</i>, old Bactrian, <i>ataredata</i>; the
Avesta recommends the name as good and saving.
The parents of Cyrus are said to belong to the tribe of
the Mardians, but later on Nicolaus himself shows
that Cyrus' ancestral home is at Pasargadae (p. 352).
In contempt the Medes might unite the whole Persian
nation under the name of their poorest tribes.
"Why have I raised up these Mardians for such
mischief?" Astyages asks in Nicolaus. The goat-tending
of the mother of Cyrus is due to the same
cause. In the account of Herodotus Cambyses is
said to be rich in herds; among the Persians the
care of flocks occupied a large place, and at a later
time the tending and protection of the flocks was one
of the means employed for strengthening and hardening
the Persian youth. Cyrus himself, in the narrative
of Nicolaus, calls himself and his father goat-herds.
When Arsaces of Armenia visited the court
of the Sassanid Shapur II. one of the first officers
at the court of Shapur insolently said: "Will the
king of the goats pasture on our slopes?"<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Such
traits as these in the Persian poems, connected with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
the poverty and simplicity of the life of the "terebinth-eating"
Persians (which Nicolaus also, following the
tradition, brings into such prominence), supplied the
Greek revision with the necessary support for changing
Cyrus into a Mardian goat-herd and beggar-boy.
Yet the true position of the parents of Cyrus breaks
through in the statement that the father of Cyrus was
satrap of Persia, and his mother the first lady in the
land, a position which also appears in the statement
in Herodotus of the noble descent and wealth of
Cambyses, and is even more plainly marked in other
passages in which the taunt is hurled at Cyrus: that
the son of Cambyses ought not to give way to a
woman,&mdash;and traces the lineage of Cyrus back to
Ach&aelig;menes, though in the account of the rebellion of
Cyrus he calls his grandfather also Cyrus.</p>

<p>The rise of Cyrus at the court of Astyages was
borrowed from another trait in the Persian poems.
The custom of the East, that the sons of distinguished
princes and nobles should perform certain courtly and
honourable services at the gate of the king, must have
been current in Media also. The Persian poems must
have proudly declared how Cyrus distinguished himself
there in his youth in the duties of the court or of
arms. This description was changed into the series of
stages by which the beggar-boy rose to the highest
office at the court of the king. The Persian account
is obviously preserved here in Deinon's narrative&mdash;like
the suckling and protection of Cyrus by the dog&mdash;in
which Cyrus before the rebellion is chief of the
staff-bearers and the body-guard of the king. When
Cyrus had won the favour of Astyages, Nicolaus is
obviously more true to the Persian account. In old
days the chaff of horses announced his elevation to
Arbaces, and to Cyrus it is announced by horse-dung,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
which is carried to him by a Persian, the slave of a
Mede, who has been recently whipped; and as to
Arbaces, so to Cyrus, a Babylonian announces that
the throne is destined for him. As Arbaces is instigated
and encouraged by Belesys, so is Cyrus by
the interpreter of dreams from Babylon, and Cyrus
promises him great rewards if he reaches the throne,
as Arbaces had promised Belesys. The conversations
of Arbaces with Belesys correspond exactly to the
conversations of Cyrus with the Babylonian and
Oebares. In Nicolaus Cyrus says, that Arbaces who
overthrew Sardanapalus was not wiser than himself,
nor were the Medes better warriors than the Persians.
But if the Median empire was founded with the help
of the Babylonian, the Persian must rise without such
assistance. Arbaces had to concede to Belesys and
his successors the hereditary dominion over Babylonia;
on this occasion Oebares takes care that in the
future empire of the Persians, Babylonia shall not be
in the way as an hereditary monarchy given in reward
of services; he removes the Babylonian against the
wishes of Cyrus. If the Medes had formerly been
able to conquer Assyria with the aid of the Babylonians,
the Persians now defeat the Medes unaided,
and if Sardanapalus was effeminate, Astyages, according
to Nicolaus, is the bravest king of the Medes after
Arbaces. To treat the struggle so briefly as Herodotus
does was impossible for Nicolaus, as the object of his
narrative was to bring out the valour of Cyrus. So
we may assume that the Persian songs gave similar
prominence to the contests before Nineveh and Pasargad&aelig;.
Arbaces is thrice defeated before Nineveh, and
inclined to retire. Astyages leads against Cyrus the
whole forces of his kingdom&mdash;more than a million
soldiers. In spite of the excellent arrangements of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Oebares and the utmost bravery, Cyrus is three times
defeated:&mdash;he is already reduced to extremities in the
fourth conflict, when the cry of the women restores
the fight. At length Oebares is able to place the
Median crown on the head of Cyrus in the tent of
Astyages. With such servants the throne and kingdom
of the Persians is more firmly established than
that of the Medes.</p>

<p>This inquiry enables us to reconstruct in its main
outlines the tradition of the Persians. Cambyses, the
descendant of Ach&aelig;menes, was the chief of the Persians.
Before the birth of Cyrus his wife had a
dream that so much water came from her "that it
was like a great river which inundated all Asia, and
flowed into the sea." We know what reverence the
Avesta pays to the dog, and the importance it ascribes
to its glance (p. 207). The suckling of the boy
Cyrus by a dog is the sign of the most bounteous
favour and most secure protection on the part of the
gods. Herodotus told us above that owing to his
origin Cyrus counted himself as more than a man,
and Xenophon represents him as begotten by gods,
springing from a line of kings, and practised from his
youth up in bravery and virtue.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> In accordance
with the custom of the Persians the son of the prince
grows up among the flocks. Mithradates, which Herodotus
gives as the name of the herdsman with whom
the boy is brought up, means "given by Mithra;"
the favourite of the god, who increases the flocks of
the farms where men worship him, and gives victory
in battles, is the protector of Cyrus. In the game of
the boys he shows by cleverness and unbroken resolution
the great destiny to which he was called. Then
he goes into service at the court of the Median king;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
where the Persian poems have already shown us
Parsondes at the time of Cyaxares, who subsequently
made the Cadusians enemies of the Medes.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> Eminent
in every position, Cyrus wins the confidence of Astyages,
and becomes the chief of his bodyguard. Then
according to Deinon's fragments he sees the sun in a
dream thrice inclining towards him. It was the
brilliance or majesty of the king which Cyrus is
represented as beholding. In the Avesta Thraetaona
and Kere&ccedil;a&ccedil;pa seize the majesty when it departs
from Yima, and the Turanian Franghra&ccedil;yan seeks
thrice to grasp the glance of the majesty.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> Then a
Persian, the slave of a Mede, brings a new sign of
good fortune to Cyrus when far from his fatherland
on the borders of the Cadusians. Oebares (Hubara,
the good bearer) is the first Persian whom Cyrus
liberates from the service of the Medes; and thus he
has gained his most faithful helper. Angares the
Mede, who warns Astyages, calls Cyrus "more mighty
than a wild boar." The singing girl also calls Cyrus
a "boar." We saw above that the victorious god
Verethraghna appears in the form of a boar, and in
that shape accompanies the chariot of Mithra.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> The
battle in the mountains of Persia, as described by
Nicolaus, belongs in all essential traits to the Persian
legend. It is precisely at Pasargadae, at the house
of Cyrus, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of Ach&aelig;menes, that the fortune of arms
changes. The proclamation of Cyrus in the tent of
Astyages, and his coronation by the Persians, which
first made him a free man instead of a Median slave,
is throughout in accordance with the meaning and
tendency of the Persian legend. The gentleness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
Cyrus towards Astyages is the counterpart of the
generosity which the Median king who conquered
Nineveh once displayed towards Belesys. Oebares
undoubtedly belongs to the Persian Epos; he is the
faithful servant who upholds the interest of the
kingdom even against the will of the king, and
sacrifices himself for it. The Persians of the best
time held it a duty to sacrifice themselves for the
king.</p>

<p>The overthrow of the Parthian empire is explained
in the same way as the overthrow of the Medes.
Papak, the prince of Fars, sees in a dream the sun
illuminating the world from the head of his herdman
Sassan. His daughter brings forth Ardeshir to
Sassan; Ardeshir serves at the court of the Parthian
king Artaban, and shoots wild asses better than anyone
else. On an announcement of the interpreters
of stars, Ardeshir flies from the court and arms the
Persians. Artaban abuses him as an impudent Kurd,
and sends the prince of Susiana to fetch him, but
this prince, and then Artaban himself, are overcome.
Shapur, the son of Ardeshir, is restored to life
against his command, and his grandson Auharmazdi
is brought up secretly, and recognised by his conduct
in the play of the boys. In both, dreams and letters
and the inborn majesty of the royal children play
their part.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p>Astyages, who ascended the throne in the year 593
<small>B.C.</small>, ruled over the Median empire for more than 30
years; he had already reached a great age when the
Persians rebelled against him. Aristotle remarks that
his effeminate life and the carelessness of his government
inspired Cyrus with courage.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> The daughter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Alyattes of Lydia, whom he had married in his youth,
had brought him no son; both the Median version
of Herodotus, and the Persian in Trogus and Ctesias,
allow Astyages a daughter only&mdash;Mandane in the
one case, in the other Amytis, the name of the sister
of Astyages, whom Nebuchadnezzar married. This
daughter, according to Ctesias and Nicolaus, Astyages
marries to Spitamas, the Mede (&Ccedil;pitama, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> the
excellent) and at the same time gives him "all Media
as a dowry." Marriage with the heiress to the throne
gave her husband the claim and right to succession.
The daughter of the king bore two sons to
Spitamas: Spitaces and Magabernes.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> About the
origin of Cyrus there is no doubt. He was the son
of Cambyses, the grandson of Teispes, the great-grandson
of Achaemenes, who united the Persian tribes
under his leadership, and recognised the sovereignty
of Phraortes the Median king. As Cyaxares and
Astyages followed Phraortes on the throne of Media,
so did Teispes and Cambyses follow Achaemenes as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
his viceroys or vassal kings over Persia. It may have
been the case that, as already remarked, after the
consolidation of the Median empire, the sovereignty
became more oppressive for the Persians, and the links
of their dependence were drawn closer. According to
the previous custom, the viceroyalty of Persia would
descend, at the death of Cambyses, to his son Cyrus.
If the custom which subsequently prevailed in the
Persian kingdom was current among the Medes, and
the sons of the satraps or princes of the subject lands
had to wait at the king's gate, and perform courtly
or martial service as hostages for the fidelity of
their fathers, and at the same time to learn obedience
and submission in order to find favour with the
king when in his immediate presence and covered by
the splendour of his power&mdash;Cyrus must also have
served at the court of Astyages, and may have filled
the office of the staff-bearer, body-guard, or of butler,
an honourable position at the court of the Medes and
Persians.  In Ecbatana he had no doubt an opportunity
of comparing the simple manners, the capacity
and vigour of his Persians, with the splendour of the
court, and the luxurious life of the Median chiefs.
Moreover, the great advantage which Spitamas had
gained by marriage with the daughter of the king
must have excited the jealousy and ambition of other
Medes who considered themselves to have a better
claim, or even raised their eyes to the throne. In the
account of Herodotus, Harpagus is said to be akin to
the family of Astyages.  It is possible that Cyrus
contemplated a breach between Persia and Media
on the death of Astyages, when he would find his
opportunity in a contested and previously disputed
succession. It may be a fact that Astyages had his
suspicions, that he summoned Cyrus who had already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
left the court before him, and Cyrus was thus compelled
to break with him sooner than he intended.
It seems more certain that Cambyses was still alive,
than that the Persians took up arms against Astyages
at the instigation of Cyrus, who was, as we have
remarked, at that time in his fortieth year.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>It follows from the position of affairs that the
Persians awaited the attack of the Medes in their own
country. It was only in the defence of the passes
of their mountains that they could hope to make
a stand against the overwhelming power of their
enemies. In this we may put confidence in the
Persian tradition, as well as in all that it has to say
of a character unfavourable to the Persians; above all,
in the fact that the war was long and severe. As a
fact the Medes appear to have twice penetrated into
the heart of the Persian land. Not only Nicolaus,
Pompeius Trogus, and Polyaenus tell us that the
struggle took place at first in Persia, and that the
battle which saved the country was fought at Pasargadae,
but also an authority of importance, Anaximenes
of Lampsacus, the contemporary of Aristotle and
Strabo (p. 357). "In reward for the services which
the women rendered in that battle," says Nicolaus,
"the women of Persia each received, when the king
came to Pasargadae, a gold coin of the value of twenty
Attic drachmas." Plutarch, as has been observed,<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
confirms this statement, on the ground of the accounts
of the companions of Alexander, in a very definite way.
We must assume, therefore, that Cyrus maintained
the independence of Persia in a very severe struggle.
When success had been obtained, he went on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
attack Media, whether it was that he did not consider
the freedom of Persia secure without the overthrow
of that country, or that he at once formed
the most ambitious designs. After a battle in Media
had given Cyrus the victory in this new war, the
chiefs of the nations subject to the Medes, the Hyrcanians,
Parthians, Sac&aelig;, and Bactrians, and finally
a part of the Medes, must have abandoned Astyages,
who, after a second defeat, fell into the hands of
Cyrus either in the encounter itself or at the capture
of Ecbatana. The walls of Ecbatana and the seven
rings round the citadel could not avert his fate
(558 <small>B.C.</small>).<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

How the succession to the throne was arranged among the Medes we
do not know in any detail, or whether their chiefs had any importance
at all; but we do see that the crown went from father to son from
Deioces downwards. In any case, even under that hypothesis, the

Trogus it is expressly said that Astyages had no son, and this is
the motive which induces Harpagus not to put Cyrus to death, as he

heiress to the throne. In Nicolaus also the daughter comes distinctly
forward, and in Ctesias she is also the heiress (<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> "Pers." 2); in the
history of the overthrow and the death of Astyages, we hear of her
constantly. At the death of Cyrus, her sons by the first marriage
receive satrapies. In Ctesias, it is true, a brother of Amytis is incidentally
mentioned, on the occasion of a later war of Cyrus ("Pers."
3). But as Ctesias is here following a Median version, and after the
death of Astyages the husband of Amytis and not her supposed
brother is removed out of the way, no importance can be attached to
this.</p></div>

529. As Cyrus, according to Herodotus, reigned 29 years after his
accession (1, 214), the beginning of his reign over Media must be
placed in 558. If Ctesias gives Cyrus a reign of 30 years ("Pers." 8),
like Deinon (p. 369), and Justin (1, 8), and Eusebius a reign of 31
years, these statements may be reconciled by the fact that Cyrus may
have taken up arms against Media 30 or 31 years before his death, and
reigned 29 years after the overthrow of Astyages. Diodorus puts the
beginning of Cyrus: Olymp. 55, 1 = 560 <small>B.C.</small> Africanus in Euseb.

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE RISE OF THE PERSIAN KINGDOM.</h3>


<p>The Median empire was not of long duration. Little
more than a century had passed since Phraortes succeeded
Deioces in the government of the land of
Ecbatana, little more than eighty since Phraortes had
united the tribes of the Medes under his leadership,
about sixty since Cyaxares had expelled the Scythians,
and not quite fifty since Nineveh had succumbed to
the arms of the Medes and Babylonians.</p>

<p>In the overthrow of so mighty a power, Cyrus had
achieved a great, and, so far as we can tell, an unexpected,
success. Scanty as our information is, we can
still perceive that he used the victory with circumspection
and moderation. Herodotus told us that he
did no injury to the captive Astyages, and kept him
with him till his death. Ctesias relates that at the
command of Cyrus, the heavy chains, which Oebares
had put on Astyages, were quickly taken off; that he
honoured him as a father; and entrusted him with the
government of the Barcanians. According to the statement
of Pompeius Trogus, Cyrus allowed him to be
viceroy of the Hyrcanians. The same nation may be
meant by these two names; in the inscriptions of Darius
Hyrcania is called Varkana, in the Avesta Vehrkana.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
Ctesias further tells us that Cyrus put to death the
Mede Spitamas, whom Astyages had married to his
daughter Amytis, and then made his successor, and
that after treating Amytis for some time as his mother
he subsequently made her his wife. No harm was
done to Megabernes and Spitaces, the sons of her
marriage with Spitamas; on the contrary, the first
was placed by the wish of Cyrus in the satrapy of
the Barcanians, the second in the satrapy of the
Derbiccians.</p>

<p>Cyrus must have made it his object to reconcile the
Medes to their defeat and loss of empire. If he could
make the house of Astyages his own, and take his
daughter to wife, the edge of the change was softened,
and the more apparent it was that this marriage had
the consent of Astyages, the more legitimate would
his rule be in the eyes of the Medes, the less could
they regard it as the dominion of a stranger. It was
of importance to gain the assent of the Medes to the
new kingdom, and support this if possible on the
united power of Medes and Persians. Moreover, the
relations of alliance in which Astyages stood to the
princely houses of Lydia and Babylonia made it
advisable to deal carefully with Astyages and his
kindred. Astyages was still alive in 549 <small>B.C.</small>,<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> according
to Herodotus and Ctesias. Whatever may be
the case as to the connection of Cyrus with Amytis,
his legitimate wife was Cassandane, the daughter of
the Persian Pharnaspes, who according to Herodotus
was an Ach&aelig;menid, and was in fact one of the
six tribal princes. Cassandane bore Cyrus two sons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
Cambyses and Bardiya, whom Herodotus calls Smerdis;
Ctesias, Tanyoxarkes; and Xenophon, Tanaoxares.
The death of Cassandane was a great grief to Cyrus;
he caused the whole kingdom to go into mourning
for her.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>With respect to the position which Cyrus took up
in regard to the royal family of Media, and Amytis
more especially, Ctesias has preserved a somewhat
incredible story. This narrative, which again is
obviously taken from a poetical source, ascribes the
death of Astyages to Oebares, to whom, according to
Trogus, Cyrus had given the government of Persia
and his sister in marriage, as a reward for his
services, who in the beginning of his reign had been
his associate in all his dangers, and whom, according
to Ctesias, he had afterwards to thank for the capture
of Sardis. The motive of this act, according to the
drift of these poems, can only have been anxiety on
the part of Oebares lest the influence of Astyages and
his friends should endanger the succession of the house
of Cyrus in the Persian kingdom and the dominion of
the Persians. Oebares had previously murdered the
Babylonian who possessed the secret which controlled
the future of Persia, against the wishes and without
the knowledge of Cyrus (p. 347), and he now acts in a
similar manner towards Astyages. Cyrus, so we are
told in our excerpt,<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> after the Lydian war sent the
eunuch Petesaces to bring Astyages from the Barcanians,
as both he and Amytis wished to see him.
Oebares advised Petesaces to abandon Astyages on
the way in some desert place, to perish by starvation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
This was done. The crime was revealed by dreams,
and Cyrus, on the repeated entreaty of Amytis, gave
Petesaces up to her for punishment. She caused
him to be blinded, flayed, and crucified. Oebares,
fearing that a similar lot was in store for him,
though Cyrus assured him that he should not permit
anything of the kind, refused all nourishment for ten
days, and so put an end to his life. The corpse
of Astyages received a splendid burial. Lions had
guarded it in the desert place in which it had been
abandoned, until Petesaces returned and carried it
away. In the poem in which the singing woman
warns Astyages against Cyrus he is compared to a
lion (p. 349). Whether the lions performed this
service to the corpse of Astyages in the source from
which Ctesias copied&mdash;it could scarcely by such an
incident exhibit him as a man favoured by heaven&mdash;or
whether the lions dealt with the corpse in a
manner more in accordance with the views of Eastern
Iran, we must leave out of the question. What is
more certain is, that the most zealous Persian could
have no real reason for putting Astyages to death, for
after the Lydian war he would be in his eightieth
year. The importance ascribed to Amytis points to
a Median version; the death of Oebares is accounted
for in a manner suitable to his life and his fidelity.</p>

<p>In Herodotus the Persians, on the instigation of
Artembares, one of their tribesmen, say to Cyrus:
"Since Zeus gives the sovereignty to the Persians,
and above all to thee, Cyrus, who hast overthrown
Astyages, so let it be thy care that we leave our land
and obtain a better, for our country is small and wild.
Many better regions are close at hand, many at a
distance, and if we gain one of them, we shall be
more admired in the eyes of men.  To do this is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
proper for men who possess the dominion, and when
can it be done better than now, when we have so
many men, and rule over all Asia?" When Cyrus
heard this he expressed no astonishment, but said
simply: they might do so, but they must be prepared
to be rulers no longer, but subjects; the same land
could not produce the noblest fruits and warlike men.
The Persians saw that Cyrus' view was the better,
and chose to inhabit and rule over a scanty land,
rather than be the slaves of others.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> The distinct
opposition of Cyrus and Artembares seems to carry
us back to Persian poems, otherwise the narrative is
less likely to belong to the tradition of Persia than
to arise out of the necessity which the Greeks felt
for explaining how the Persians succeeded in founding
so mighty an empire from a mountain country so
moderate in extent.</p>

<p>In any case the Persians, after the overthrow of
Media, were far from possessing the dominion over
Asia. In Nicolaus, it is true, when the news is spread
abroad that Astyages has retired from Persia and
has fled before Cyrus in the first battle in Media,
the chief of the Hyrcanians comes with 50,000 men,
to pay homage to Cyrus as king; he is followed by
the chiefs of the Parthians, Sac&aelig;, and Bactrians, and
then by the remaining nations. But as a fact the
course of things seems to have been different. If the
princes and natives who were subject to the Medes
were ready to throw off their dominion as soon as
they were defeated by the Persians, they were hardly
inclined to recognise Cyrus as sovereign in the room
of Astyages. Herodotus tells us that Cyrus subjugated
the Bactrians and Sac&aelig;, and Upper Asia, one
nation after the other, and puts these conquests after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
the Lydian war.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Xenophon represents the Hyrcanians
as joining Cyrus at an early date, and the Cadusians
follow their example, which harmonises with the view
taken in the Persian poems of the hatred of the
Cadusians to the Medes. In Xenophon and Ctesias
the Sac&aelig; are the allies of Cyrus as early as 549 <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
If Astyages receives the satrapy of the Hyrcanians
in Justin, this nation and the Parthians, who were
still nearer neighbours of Media, must have been
among those who were subject to Cyrus.</p>

<p>In Ctesias, Cyrus after the conquest of Astyages
marches against the Bactrians; the battle was undecided.
But when they found that Astyages was
the father and Amytis the wife of Cyrus, the Bactrians
voluntarily submitted to Amytis and Cyrus.
Then Cyrus conquered the Sac&aelig;, and took their king
Amorges captive. We remember that, according to
Herodotus' statement, the proper name of the Sac&aelig; was
Amyrgians, and in the inscriptions of Darius we found
the &Ccedil;aka Humavarka. The name Amorges seems to
be borrowed from the Amyrgians. When Amorges
had been defeated and taken captive by Cyrus, his
wife Sparethra, as she is called in Ctesias, collected
the Sac&aelig; and took the field with them. Zarinaea,
a princess of the Sac&aelig;, had previously fought with
great bravery against the Medes, but her achievements
are far surpassed by those of Sparethra. With
300,000 men and 200,000 armed women, she went
against the Persians, and defeated Cyrus, taking many
captives, among whom were Medes of distinction. As
a ransom for these Amorges was restored to Sparethra,
and there was friendship between Cyrus and the king
of the Sac&aelig;, and the latter marched with him to the
war against the Lydians. Strabo also speaks of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
battle in which Cyrus was defeated by the Sac&aelig;.
Being hard pressed on his retreat he abandoned his
camp with large stores of every kind, especially of
wine. When the Sac&aelig; had enjoyed their spoil,
Cyrus fell upon them and massacred nearly all.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>Trogus following Deinon tells us that the nations
who were subject to the Medes did not submit to
Cyrus. Hence arose many wars. The greater part of
these nations he had already overpowered, before he
marched against the Lydians, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> in the first eight
years after the overthrow of Astyages. We may assume
that Cyrus, immediately after the dethronement of
Astyages, was occupied with bringing the neighbours
of Media on the east, north, and west into obedience
to the new kingdom. So long as the Parthians,
Hyrcanians, Armenians, were independent or in arms
against Cyrus, the Medes must be strongly tempted
to recover their lost dominion. The Cadusians in
Ghilan were subjects of Cyrus; at any rate the name
of the city Cyropolis on the Caspian Sea, on the
coast of the Cadusians, is a proof that Cyrus placed a
fortress there, in order to keep them or their neighbours
in check; and under the successors of Cyrus
the Cadusians are always mentioned as subjects.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>
Then he took the same line towards the west, on
which Cyaxares of Media had advanced sixty years
previously after driving out the Scythians; he gained
Armenia and Cappadocia, and made the Halys the
border of his kingdom towards Lydia. In his narrative
of the events of the year 549 <small>B.C.</small>, Herodotus
remarks that the Cappadocians were subject to Cyrus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
having previously been subjects of the Medes. It is
clear from repeated statements that at this time the
Halys was the western border of the empire of Cyrus.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>
Xenophon reckons the subjugation of the Armenians,
who had been subjects of the Medes, among the
earliest achievements of Cyrus; he tells the story
in his own manner, and places after this the subjection
of the neighbours on the south, the Chald&aelig;ans
(Gordy&aelig;ans) who dwelt in the mountains
which separate the table-land of Armenia from the
hilly country of Assyria. The legends of the Cappadocians
conceal their subjugation to Cyrus under
supposed links of alliance; Cambyses, the father of
Cyrus, had given his own sister Atossa in marriage to
Pharnaces, the king of the Cappadocians.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> The extension
of the Persian dominion to the east over
Parthia and Hyrcania, the subjugation of the Drangians,
Gedrosians, and Arachoti, must, in consideration
of the observation of Herodotus, that in 548 <small>B.C.</small>
Cyrus was intent on military preparations against
the Bactrians and Sac&aelig;, and the urgent difficulties
which at that time summoned him to the east, be
placed in the later years of his reign; in fact, they
cannot come earlier than the second decade; which
does not, however, make it impossible that Cyrus
should have fought against the Bactrians and Sac&aelig;
in the first decade.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>Cyrus must have arranged his court and state after
the pattern of Media, which in its turn was a copy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
of the court of the kings of Asshur and Babylon.
Ctesias asserts that Petesaces, the eunuch, and after
his death Bagapates, another eunuch, had great influence
with Cyrus.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> The abode of Ach&aelig;menes,
Teispes, and Carabyses, the ancient place of assembly
and metropolis of the tribe of the Pasargad&aelig;, was
changed by Cyrus into a city and fortress; there he
built his palace, in which he deposited the spoil of
his wars, and collected his treasures.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> The new
kingdom rested on the power of the Persians; they
alone had to pay no tribute to the king; they formed
the nucleus of the army; the leaders and satraps
were mainly chosen from them. But Cyrus was
obviously anxious to reconcile the Medes, next to
the Persians, with the change in affairs, and win
their aid. This design lay at the base of his treatment
of Astyages and the marriage with his daughter, and
scarcely ten years after the fall of the Median kingdom,
we find Medes at the head of the army of
Cyrus. The clemency of Cyrus towards the other
subject nations is also extolled. Herodotus vouches
for the fact that he laid no fixed tribute upon them,
but left it to themselves to fix the amount of their
yearly contributions. Of all men, Xenophon says,
Cyrus made the largest presents, and exhibited the
greatest liberality towards those who had done him
good service, and in this the subsequent kings of
Persia followed his example.</p>

<p>According to Xenophon's description, Cyrus was
of a kindly disposition, eager to instruct himself, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
so ambitious that he shrank from no effort and no
danger.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> With the Greeks he passes not only for
the founder of the dominion of the Persians, but
for the author of excellent arrangements in the kingdom.
From this point of view Xenophon wrote his
treatise on Cyrus. By his example he wished to
prove to the Greeks how the empire over nations
could be gained, how a great kingdom could be
founded and maintained, how a ruler could command
obedience even among those who had never seen
him and were separated by great distances. It is
a historical romance which he has written on Cyrus;
but he knew the Persian empire, and could not
advance anything absolutely in contradiction to the
current opinion of the Greeks about Cyrus. According
to him the relation of Cyrus to the Persians
rested on a kind of compact. When his son had
subjugated the nations far and wide, Cambyses collected
the elders of the Persians and the officers
who held the highest places, and told them the
Persians had elected Cyrus to be their general, and
given him the army; Cyrus had extended their
power over Asia, and gained glory among all men;
he had made the bravest men in the army rich, and
found pay and food for all the soldiers. If this
relation were maintained it would be for the advantage
of both parties; if, on the other hand, Cyrus
sought to rule over the Persians with the same caprice
as over other nations, or the Persians should attempt
to take the command from him, each would do the
greatest harm to the other. Let Cyrus, therefore,
undertake to protect Persia and uphold the Persian
laws, and the Persians to render Cyrus any service
that he needed against rebellion and enemies. "After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
me," Cambyses concludes, "Cyrus will be king, and
whenever he comes to Persia he will offer for you
the sacrifice which I am offering now. If he is
in a foreign land, it will be best for the noblest
of our family to offer sacrifices to the gods." "What
Cambyses proposed was approved by Cyrus and the
Persians with invocations to the gods, and the arrangement
is still observed on both sides."<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> Plato
even puts Cyrus on the same level as Lycurgus,
the founder of the constitution of Sparta. He gives
Dion the choice of rivalling the ancient Lycurgus or
Cyrus, or any one else who may be distinguished
by moral excellence and political wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> According
to the Laws, Cyrus, brought up from his youth
in the camp and surrounded by danger, became a
skilful general, and as a ruler kept before his eyes
the prosperity of the state. In the same book we
are told that the monarchical form of government
attained its most complete state among the Persians,
and the democratic among the Athenians. But as
the Persian state pursued absolute dominion, and
the Attic uncontrolled freedom, neither discovered
the correct limit; though in ancient times they had
observed due moderation. At the time of Cyrus the
Persians were midway between slavery and freedom.
At first they were free, then they became the lords
of others.  But while ruling they had given the
subjects a share in freedom, and treated them on
an equal footing. For this reason the warriors were
devoted to their general and ready to plunge into
danger. And if an intelligent man appeared, who
could give wise counsel, Cyrus gave him liberty to
speak; and as he honoured those who knew how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
to give advise, every opinion was made use of for
the common good, and the Persians of that day
succeeded in everything by freedom, concord, and
common deliberation.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
